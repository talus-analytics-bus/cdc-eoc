1
00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:09.960
Claire Standley (she/her): Today i'm going to talk a little bit about coordination of operations as a critical competency within the context of public health emergency operation centers.

2
00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:21.210
Claire Standley (she/her): So overall coordination of operations refers to the ability to direct and support an incident, by establishing a scalable system of oversight organizations you provision.

3
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:34.080
Claire Standley (she/her): In this way, you can see immediately how they're a strong alignment with IMS in terms of ensuring that there isn't an overlap of responsibilities and a clear system of command and control.

4
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.100
Claire Standley (she/her): Multi sectoral coordination specifically is actually required competency for public health preparedness and response.

5
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:53.490
Claire Standley (she/her): Under the International Health Regulations and is afforded indicators and the joint external evaluation tool part of the process for multi sectoral coordination is stakeholder coordination, which is a crucial component.

6
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:09.570
Claire Standley (she/her): stakeholder coordination and important concept in my operations, because of the rapid and chaotic nature of a public health emergency this often requires involved in multiple responders even multiple types of responders which can potentially come from different sectors.

7
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.570
Claire Standley (she/her): Coordination the responders as therefore needed to minimize overlaps and gaps in the response.

8
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:27.630
Claire Standley (she/her): Along with ensuring the response efforts address the needs of those most affected, again, we can see the similarities here with the IMS approach, ensuring that there's clear roles and responsibilities for all the members of the response.

9
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:39.420
Claire Standley (she/her): These are just a few components that are critical to the stakeholder coordination process so identification of the key stakeholders versus philosophy, the subject of another lecture.

10
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:48.450
Claire Standley (she/her): And that can be the agencies, the ministry, the other types of institutions that you might need to engage with also the individual focal points within those institutions.

11
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:58.980
Claire Standley (she/her): you'll need to agree on terms of objectives for the coordination team again most effectively done through an IMS framework with clear roles and responsibilities.

12
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:09.450
Claire Standley (she/her): You need to distribute those roles tasks and responsibilities among your your team and agreement on the working terms related to information sharing tasks responsibilities and the organization.

13
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:20.400
Claire Standley (she/her): Again, having an IMS set set up in place already can greatly facilitate these by already having some of those common protocols processes and terminologies in place.

14
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.450
Claire Standley (she/her): These this list is just a number of the examples of stakeholders that you might want to think about in terms of coordination of operations.

15
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:44.160
Claire Standley (she/her): With respect to say an epidemic response, or some other type of public health emergency so obviously government agencies are often critical, especially if the public health emergency operations Center is part of a government ministry or run through the government.

16
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.660
Claire Standley (she/her): management processes, there may be other ministries that you need to coordinate with other representatives from different branches of government.

17
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.680
Claire Standley (she/her): You may work with non governmental organizations or even international and multilateral organizations like the World Health Organization.

18
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:16.500
Claire Standley (she/her): And as we'll talk about a little bit more communities themselves are a key stakeholder and comprised of civil society groups volunteer groups religious groups, even just Community representatives and many others, but again i'll mention, there is a bit more detail in a moment.

19
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:28.260
Claire Standley (she/her): So as as mentioned the Community can in fact often be one of the most influential stakeholders on the ground in terms of compliance with response measures as we've seen through the covert 19 pandemic.

20
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.840
Claire Standley (she/her): For this reason, it's very important to identify who is influential in the Community.

21
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:45.540
Claire Standley (she/her): Who are the groups and the leaders within your community that can have influence on others and help them, pass on your messaging and contribute proactively and positively to your response operations.

22
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:53.820
Claire Standley (she/her): And just as a general practice it's particularly important to incorporate Community engagement as a common practice throughout.

23
00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:08.970
Claire Standley (she/her): Throughout the eeoc practices and that can include in the preparedness recovery and mitigation phases, as well as during the response, there should be a common practice for the ptsd and part of the routine operations of the of the pH you see.

24
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.590
Claire Standley (she/her): Some examples of Community based groups that often have quite a lot of influence in their particular communities can include women's groups.

25
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.770
Claire Standley (she/her): youth groups teachers groups volunteers religious groups and even Community health workers and volunteers as well.

26
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:38.400
Claire Standley (she/her): In some settings there may be existing committees that incorporate representatives from each of these groups and leveraging or engaging with those committees can therefore be a really effective way of engaging all these different types of influencers.

27
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:49.770
Claire Standley (she/her): And, here again, are just a few additional community leaders that you might want to consider in your coordination efforts local political leaders traditional healers and traditional leaders.

28
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.440
Claire Standley (she/her): So, in the context of a public health emergency, there are some additional critical areas that would need to be addressed in coordination efforts, so these can include.

29
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:07.320
Claire Standley (she/her): Public communication social mobilization interpersonal communication within members of your team or within other stakeholders in the response.

30
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:16.470
Claire Standley (she/her): One should always think about monitoring and evaluation of the communication approaches to ensure that you're having the desired impact and to help with continuous improvement.

31
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:27.570
Claire Standley (she/her): And there's also making sure that there's open communication with other sectors or clusters in the context of the humanity, where a humanitarian type of response may be underway.

32
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.500
Claire Standley (she/her): So, going back to Community engagement again.

33
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:40.530
Claire Standley (she/her): This refers to incorporating those affected by the risks or by the public health emergency that you're trying to address in the community into the different processes.

34
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:49.980
Claire Standley (she/her): To help them understand the risk they face and involve them in the response actions increasingly in public health, we talked about co production, even a response measures.

35
00:05:50.220 --> 00:06:00.240
Claire Standley (she/her): That means working with the Community to design response measures that are immediately and intrinsically acceptable to Community that you already have their buy in from the very beginning.

36
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.600
Claire Standley (she/her): So some of the approaches and tactics that are linked to Community engagement include social mobilization which was mentioned before.

37
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:12.540
Claire Standley (she/her): behavior change communication and there are specific tools and skills that can be used to advance that.

38
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:27.090
Claire Standley (she/her): health, education and health promotion again things like health, education, health promotion are often part of routine public health activities, and so it can be important to leverage those existing programs within the context of an emergency response to ensure greater advocacy.

39
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:44.730
Claire Standley (she/her): In terms of more of the crisis side, we can have outbreak communication crisis communication and risk communication and then again another lecture will focus more specifically on emergency risk communications and some of the key considerations that need to be taken into context there.

40
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:54.360
Claire Standley (she/her): it's important to recognize, of course, that's depending on the nature and scale of the events coordination for risk community.

41
00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:04.620
Claire Standley (she/her): functions will vary, along with the actions that are expected from stakeholders, and this means that also there can be different actions taken at different levels so, for example, at the local level.

42
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:11.040
Claire Standley (she/her): You may want to start identifying those influential stakeholders finding out who they are, and creating real and.

43
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:19.560
Claire Standley (she/her): Then again, this can happen, even before the the response happens and it's important to try and establish those relationships in the mitigation phase.

44
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:29.280
Claire Standley (she/her): Two to ensure that the relationships are in place when the response happens and you're not scrambling to try and identify contacts in the communities during the middle of an emergency.

45
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:40.770
Claire Standley (she/her): You can have those you can help create those relationships, by having courtesy visits and again involving and engaging stakeholders from the beginning in activities and the decision making process.

46
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:48.000
Claire Standley (she/her): At the sub national national level some of these activities will be similar, although a bit different because more likely tailored towards.

47
00:07:48.600 --> 00:08:05.760
Claire Standley (she/her): Leadership or key technical personnel in institutions ministries, NGOs and other stakeholders at that level again prioritization identification of key contacts and establishing relationships, for me, key within this level of engagement as well.

48
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:13.470
Claire Standley (she/her): So i'm just going to briefly talk through a few examples of stakeholder coordination in the context of the curve in 19 pandemic.

49
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:21.810
Claire Standley (she/her): And then, at the very end i'll talk briefly about the one health approach to multi sectoral coordination, so the covered 19 response has.

50
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:36.810
Claire Standley (she/her): been unprecedented in terms of scale and scope and has resulted in many countries, creating either formal or informal multi sectoral coordination mechanism to help manage the varied and wide reaching impacts of the pandemic.

51
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:43.830
Claire Standley (she/her): So here are a few examples, the activities identified generally reflect the interest of the stakeholders.

52
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:53.310
Claire Standley (she/her): And each country demonstrates how these can vary depending on the situation, the resources available and the different stakeholders involved, as well as the broader epidemiological context.

53
00:08:53.700 --> 00:09:01.770
Claire Standley (she/her): So Taiwan, for example, took a very proactive approach to testing and, particularly, importantly, from the very beginning of the of the epidemic.

54
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:09.600
Claire Standley (she/her): There was good coordination, the integration between the various multi layer governance structures within Taiwan, but also with.

55
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:22.980
Claire Standley (she/her): The national health insurance system and insurance companies, who also coordinated very closely with border control what this meant was that, as soon as individuals, Andrew Taiwan, and this was especially important, since there is a lot of.

56
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:30.540
Claire Standley (she/her): Air travel between Taiwan and the southern Chinese mainland, which is, of course, where the epidemic cases were first detected.

57
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:39.900
Claire Standley (she/her): There was a very quick and rapid information sharing about individuals coming from high risk regions they could be monitored, they could have their health information.

58
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:48.180
Claire Standley (she/her): facts and that information, the themis the past into the health information system so that they could receive appropriate guidance and care.

59
00:09:50.730 --> 00:10:06.150
Claire Standley (she/her): South Korea was became very well known, particularly for rapidly setting up large scale testing and again that involves a large number of different stakeholders South Korea had also benefited from the experience of having a.

60
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:11.700
Claire Standley (she/her): mers outbreak Middle East respiratory send them current a virus outbreak, a few years ago.

61
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:27.300
Claire Standley (she/her): which had already established some of these coordination mechanisms and and also the legal foundation for rapid development and deployment of testing so again emphasizing the proactive nature of some of the preparedness measures that then we'll the dividends, and the response.

62
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:37.860
Claire Standley (she/her): In Turkey, the government acted also quite proactively in terms of its policy style and one example to highlight here was the way that the government.

63
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:51.570
Claire Standley (she/her): worked closely with religious authorities to pass on messaging related to the lockdown and the other types of public health measures that were being put in place to try and create stronger Community engagement and social mobilization.

64
00:10:53.310 --> 00:11:01.770
Claire Standley (she/her): And then finally i'll mentioned, New Zealand, New Zealand, one of the countries that has continued to pursue, at least until very recently and elimination.

65
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.980
Claire Standley (she/her): strategy with respect to covert so very low tolerance for any cases at all, and one of the ways.

66
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:16.170
Claire Standley (she/her): In which you, New Zealand, was able to achieve this, despite the challenges that posed in terms of restricting international travel and posing.

67
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:25.200
Claire Standley (she/her): Mandatory quarantine on anyone entering the country and, in fact, New Zealand stopped almost all non New Zealanders from entering New Zealand.

68
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:34.050
Claire Standley (she/her): Was the really strong social organization and Community engagement that came from the very highest levels of the government, the Prime Minister herself.

69
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:41.820
Claire Standley (she/her): Often appeared on Facebook videos and other messaging services to to share with her, her people.

70
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:54.630
Claire Standley (she/her): Her ideas and her decisions regarding the pandemic and in this way, they created a very strong sense of community and of all New Zealanders working together to confront the pandemic and to keep everyone safe.

71
00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:04.620
Claire Standley (she/her): And so, although that has that has changed slightly, so the government has recognized the need to adjust their approach to be continued and emissivity of covert 19 on a global level.

72
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:15.540
Claire Standley (she/her): It has been a very successful strategy overall in terms of keeping the population very much on board with the government's policies and keeping case numbers and death numbers extremely extremely low.

73
00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:31.590
Claire Standley (she/her): So i'll also briefly mentioned the one health approach, so this is a collaborative multi sectoral and trans disciplinary approach that works across all levels so local, regional, national and global with a goal of achieving optimal health outcomes in.

74
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:39.030
Claire Standley (she/her): Animals plans and their shared environment so it's a very holistic strategy that is inherently multi sectoral approach.

75
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.580
Claire Standley (she/her): And of course operationalize in one House therefore requires substantial stakeholder coordination.

76
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:51.300
Claire Standley (she/her): Within the context of emergency operations one health has most commonly been used in the context of zoonotic diseases.

77
00:12:51.570 --> 00:13:04.650
Claire Standley (she/her): Where there's a need to engage the animal health and environmental sectors as well to understand transmission dynamics and perhaps to implement interventions that can stop transmission of disease between humans and animals and reduce morbidity and both.

78
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:21.960
Claire Standley (she/her): Moreover, as mentioned at the very beginning of this presentation, establishing a strong one health coordination mechanisms as part of an overall multi sectoral coordination approach to emergency operations can contribute to country compliance to the International Health Regulations.

79
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:28.620
Claire Standley (she/her): As a quick example of stakeholder coordination for in the context of one health.

80
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:38.700
Claire Standley (she/her): comes from Kenya so Kenya, like many other countries for started implementing one health as a formal government strategy in the wake of that.

81
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:50.130
Claire Standley (she/her): highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak in 2004 2005 and so by 2006 there was a multi sectoral committee that was set up to enhance influenza preparedness.

82
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:57.960
Claire Standley (she/her): And this committee was very quickly tested in a large rift valley fever outbreak in 2006 2007.

83
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:06.960
Claire Standley (she/her): But because the preparedness that have been put in place for influenza, which which had involved coordination between multiple ministries and different stakeholders.

84
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:20.310
Claire Standley (she/her): The government was able to mount a strong and well coordinated response to rift valley fever, which resulted in minimal loss of life, compared to previous outbreaks of the disease, and this was credited to the structures that were put in place by the one health agenda.

85
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:31.110
Claire Standley (she/her): And this success, then galvanized stakeholders to further build and sustain one health efforts in Kenya, which eventually led to the establishment of the genetic disease unit in 2012.

86
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:39.150
Claire Standley (she/her): And as you notice each unit is based on a formal Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture.

87
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:54.000
Claire Standley (she/her): there's also now close engagement with the wildlife authorities in Kenya and there's no disease unit is is both a physical building and also operates now at the county level with the sub national level in Kenya and places.

88
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.290
Claire Standley (she/her): But the managers from the veterinary side and from the human health side.

89
00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:08.520
Claire Standley (she/her): to work together in the same room to respond jointly to infectious disease outbreaks that might have zoonotic origins, as well as to think more broadly about risk reduction.

90
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:16.350
Claire Standley (she/her): For public health emergencies, in the context of the International Health Regulations in Kenya and this approach has been seen as a model.

91
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:25.650
Claire Standley (she/her): to emulate in other countries and and certainly has been very successful and enhancing kenya's preparedness and response capabilities to priorities do not have diseases.

92
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:38.970
Claire Standley (she/her): So there's some additional references for further reading on the subject of stakeholder coordination and multi sectoral coordination, more generally, in the context of public health emergency operations, thank you.
