1
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:09.420
Claire Standley (she/her): hello, and welcome to this lecture on the incident management system, and specifically delving a little bit more into the planning section.

2
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:21.510
Claire Standley (she/her): So the planning section is responsible for the evaluation, the situation, the assessment of options throw out the response, or perhaps even during the alert phase as well.

3
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:31.440
Claire Standley (she/her): and of keeping track and probably speaking of the resources that are available to this end to can be in charge of aggregating and processing data that come into the emergency operation Center.

4
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.860
Claire Standley (she/her): Developing and communicating operational information again between partners or within sections of the eeoc.

5
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:45.150
Claire Standley (she/her): predicting how events may evolve within the response and trying to anticipate those events from when when they occur.

6
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:57.270
Claire Standley (she/her): Developing objectives strategies and action plans include the incident Action Plan and identifying the technical expertise that may be needed to successfully respond to the event or incident in question.

7
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:09.330
Claire Standley (she/her): To this end, like all of the other sections within the IMS the planning function can be adapted, based on the needs and requirements of an incident or or the type of event or response that's being.

8
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:18.000
Claire Standley (she/her): addressed so specific activities that are associated with the planning section can include risk analysis and needs assessment again.

9
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:31.230
Claire Standley (she/her): This can be also part of a continuous cycle of efforts throughout the emergency management cycles so encompassing the preparedness phase, as well as during the response effort itself, and perhaps even into their recovery.

10
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.290
Claire Standley (she/her): It includes developing information products and disseminating them to the required stakeholders or partners.

11
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:45.030
Claire Standley (she/her): include strategic response and operations planning so again trying to anticipate what's coming down the road and planning for those events.

12
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.640
Claire Standley (she/her): Monitoring the ongoing response, including evaluation also afterwards, which we'll get to in a second and overall project management of the response.

13
00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:07.350
Claire Standley (she/her): So, in summary, the major responsibility of the planning section is to map out and task all available resources, both human and material to achieve maximum effectiveness in the emergency operations Center.

14
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:18.510
Claire Standley (she/her): Specifically, in the context of public health emergencies, the planning act section might be involved in activities such as developing the incident action plans, the eye peas.

15
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.310
Claire Standley (she/her): templates of which are available on the website for you to use and develop.

16
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:34.560
Claire Standley (she/her): oversight of the after action review process and increasingly as we've seen in the code 19 pandemic interaction reviews as well, which i'll talk about more in a second.

17
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.690
Claire Standley (she/her): to predict and plan for any future responses that may come down the line to develop a specific specific response objectives and strategies.

18
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:57.300
Claire Standley (she/her): So, in the context of the curve at 19 pandemic, for example, that could be developing specific objectives related to controlling transmission or analyzing the impact of interventions on the epidemiological situation on the ground.

19
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.000
Claire Standley (she/her): to identify technical expertise that may be needed to address particular needs during the response efforts.

20
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:11.280
Claire Standley (she/her): To develop and communicate event specific courses of action, both across short and long term range planning, as well as operational information.

21
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:26.220
Claire Standley (she/her): And to keep any emergency related documentation for post response investigations increase and review, so in that sense the planning section also has an important role and accountability and transparency of the operations of the emergency operations Center.

22
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.200
Claire Standley (she/her): So i'll just provide two examples of how the planning section has contributed to.

23
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:43.470
Claire Standley (she/her): This first example is a specific country response in Nigeria and following on from what we've heard in the previous IMS introductory lecture on.

24
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:54.030
Claire Standley (she/her): The Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2014 and then the second example is more general about the use of interaction reviews so here, as you may recall from the previous lecture in Nigeria.

25
00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:01.500
Claire Standley (she/her): The first case of Ebola was detected in Lagos and in July of 2014 and the polio program infrastructure.

26
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:10.320
Claire Standley (she/her): Was leveraged which included an emergency operation Center to support a number of different activities for the response to the outbreak.

27
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:19.050
Claire Standley (she/her): So, first of all, the eeoc was organized into functional units roughly along the lines of an IMS structure related to specific.

28
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:33.510
Claire Standley (she/her): technical capabilities that were required so These included epidemiology and surveillance on the operation side case management laboratory services, social mobilization and points of entry and exit plus there is an overall management and coordination, you as well.

29
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:42.690
Claire Standley (she/her): And incident manager was identified and designated qualified leaders for each of those units and so established the command structure in that way.

30
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:53.580
Claire Standley (she/her): And, in so doing they defined the scope and limitations of the year, see the defined what the eeoc would be responsible for during the response and what it would not be responsible for.

31
00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:08.310
Claire Standley (she/her): specific to the planning section they adapted standard operating procedures again that had already been in place for polio response specifically to the ED outbreak, taking into account the specific epidemiological and and biological.

32
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.130
Claire Standley (she/her): fact variables associated with Ebola virus disease that we need to be taking a consideration.

33
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:27.120
Claire Standley (she/her): Similarly, they developed a standard operating procedures for screening travelers given the risk of case importation case containment if If cases suspect or then confirm cases were identified.

34
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.400
Claire Standley (she/her): And created some travel advisories around the risk of Ebola virus disease.

35
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:40.980
Claire Standley (she/her): event specific courses of action we're also developed for situations that the srp did not cover as the response evolved so again.

36
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:50.580
Claire Standley (she/her): demonstrating that the role of the planning section plays in anticipating and responding to dynamic events that may change during the course of the response.

37
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:58.680
Claire Standley (she/her): And then, finally, an evaluation plan was developed to monitor this stage of the outbreak on a daily level in meetings with the eeoc personnel.

38
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:16.740
Claire Standley (she/her): And these specific activities helps to keep the Nigeria usc well abreast of developments in the course of the epidemic and helped ensure continuity of operations and support to all of the other functional units within the usc and contributed to successfully containing the outbreak.

39
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:25.980
Claire Standley (she/her): So I mentioned interaction reviews previously so specifically with respect to covet 19 the prolonged nature of the response has.

40
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:39.660
Claire Standley (she/her): identified a potential need to improve ongoing activities and actions so while after action reviews a ours are a standard practice and public health emergency management and, indeed, are one of the voluntary.

41
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:49.440
Claire Standley (she/her): monitoring and evaluation requirements under the International Health Regulations after either a simulation exercise or a real outbreak.

42
00:06:50.130 --> 00:07:00.840
Claire Standley (she/her): The nature of the curve in 19 pandemic has highlighted the need to also review performance that intermediary stages during the response and so to that end guidance has been developed.

43
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:15.120
Claire Standley (she/her): by the World Health Organization others for the process of interaction reviews, so the idea here is that there is an opportunity for root cause analysis so identifying some of the contributing factors and collective discourse.

44
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.350
Claire Standley (she/her): Around the ongoing response efforts to improve how about me.

45
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:26.910
Claire Standley (she/her): Go on, they can be retrospective so looking back at how the response has been going to identify opportunities for improvement.

46
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:39.210
Claire Standley (she/her): But also perspective, trying to anticipate what is coming next and how the eeoc can better adapt or better respond to those emerging challenges are emerging changes in the situation.

47
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:47.730
Claire Standley (she/her): And those particular those prospective reviews can be particularly helpful if the epidemiological context suggests that there will be.

48
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.750
Claire Standley (she/her): Another surge and transmission, or that there will the the response will be prolonged for some time after that that moment.

49
00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:04.290
Claire Standley (she/her): So the objectives, broadly speaking of interaction reviews are for collect learning again so that all partners and stakeholders can gather together to discuss.

50
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:11.820
Claire Standley (she/her): How the response has been going and to identify opportunities for improvement through that you can share experiences.

51
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:20.100
Claire Standley (she/her): Hopefully, identify where things may be going well, as well as where there may be challenges or bottlenecks that limit the responsibility.

52
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:27.090
Claire Standley (she/her): And then, particularly important for prospective interaction reviews is the concept of resiliency so.

53
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:37.440
Claire Standley (she/her): To what extent are the human resources within your response feeling the strain of the prolonged response effort how resilient are they and what might be needed to address any.

54
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:49.560
Claire Standley (she/her): mental or physical health burdens that they may be carrying based on having been responding at hyler for so long, and then, of course, also operational resilience, so the idea that, how are the resources.

55
00:08:49.920 --> 00:09:03.270
Claire Standley (she/her): financial or material and processes and systems within your etc how resilient are of age, the changes that have been wrought during the pandemic during the response efforts and how can they be sustained moving forward as well.

56
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:21.000
Claire Standley (she/her): So that's a very brief overview of the planning section, here are some additional resources to refer to, and please also look at the the broader website where we have additional resources that may be helpful, such as templates for SAP and I piece that may help guide.

57
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.840
Claire Standley (she/her): me help guide your work will be adapted for use within your emergency operation Center Thank you very much.
