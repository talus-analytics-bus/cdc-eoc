00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.820
Claire Standley (she/her): hello, my name is Claire Stanley and i'm going to give a brief introduction today about incident management systems or I am.

2
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:28.770
Claire Standley (she/her): So I am as an organizational model that can be used for all hazards of emergencies and it provides the template for incident management and can be applicable, regardless of the cost size vacation or complexity event.

3
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.740
Claire Standley (she/her): This type of approach is actually first developed in the 1970s by emergency responders in California.

4
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:45.000
Claire Standley (she/her): They have been battling a series of large wildfires that required lots of different agencies to work together and we're finding that they have problems with communication coordination and logistics.

5
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.730
Claire Standley (she/her): By working across these different agencies, for example, different agencies, sometimes use different terminology, for the same things which could lead to misunderstandings.

6
00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.540
Claire Standley (she/her): They also use different call signs or radio frequencies, which made it more challenging to have quick and effective communication.

7
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.760
Claire Standley (she/her): As such, after these incidents they developed a new type of system called the incident command system.

8
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:15.420
Claire Standley (she/her): Which shared common terminology and other approaches for facilitating quick and easy coordination across different agencies in the event of large scale emergencies.

9
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:24.270
Claire Standley (she/her): For the next several years the incident command system or ice house was primarily used only for wildfires, but it was later adopted expanded.

10
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:33.600
Claire Standley (she/her): and made more focused on an all hazards approach that can be applied to any type of size or scope of incidents and that's what we now know as the incident management system.

11
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:44.430
Claire Standley (she/her): The IMS facility it's managing complex public health emergencies through five functions management planning operations logistics finance administration.

12
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.730
Claire Standley (she/her): As mentioned previously, the IMS model is flexible and adaptable to visit individual events agencies and jurisdictions.

13
00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:05.910
Claire Standley (she/her): It can also be expanded or contracted for depending on the size or scope of the incident and can be used across all types of hazards situations all types of disasters are emergencies.

14
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:22.350
Claire Standley (she/her): A few other key aspects of rms that make it particularly useful for communication and coordination instance, or that it identifies key functions it's not based on rank or hierarchy, the relationship between the key functions is also defined in a clear way.

15
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.350
Claire Standley (she/her): is also specify the chain of command, so it says, who should report to whom.

16
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:38.580
Claire Standley (she/her): and also a mandates a reasonable fan of control, in other words, no individual should be responsible for more than, say three to five other individuals in their chain of command.

17
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.910
Claire Standley (she/her): This reduces the burden of decision making and spreads it across the organization and and clear and transparent way.

18
00:02:45.810 --> 00:03:00.960
Claire Standley (she/her): The IMS also emphasizes support for the logistic function as well as decision making, through the planning function as essential elements supporting operations and finally IMS provides assistance common terminology responders can talk and understand each other.

19
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.840
Claire Standley (she/her): through all of this is enables local, regional and national authorities to coordinate based on the needs of emergencies and the available resource.

20
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:18.060
Claire Standley (she/her): And it provides a structure to response, supporting the collaboration between various sectors and even between governmental and non governmental organizations.

21
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:30.240
Claire Standley (she/her): In this way, lots of different actors can successfully apply IMS within their own jurisdictions, including national departments ministries and agencies sub national agencies departments or other jurisdictions.

22
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.960
Claire Standley (she/her): Even local response responders and Community organizations, as well as the private sector or private industry.

23
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.350
Claire Standley (she/her): The World Health Organization has also adopted an IMS model for its own emergency response functions.

24
00:03:49.590 --> 00:04:04.110
Claire Standley (she/her): This is a schematic showing the five sections of the WHO, I have mess as a few years ago and, as you can see these meet the same five functions that we previously discussed management operations planning, logistics and financial administration.

25
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.240
Claire Standley (she/her): Each of these will be described in more detail and subsequent lectures, but will give a brief overview here.

26
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:18.060
Claire Standley (she/her): The management function is the executive operational and coordination function involves decision making and risk communication.

27
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:29.280
Claire Standley (she/her): The operation function and the operation section supports the tactical application of resources and often is the one of the lead functions in and it responds in terms of the on the ground operations.

28
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:38.550
Claire Standley (she/her): The planning section is responsible for the evaluation situation assessment of options and keeping track of resources available, including some of the decision making functions mentioned previously.

29
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:52.350
Claire Standley (she/her): and logistics function manages the acquisition and deployment of resources human as well as financial or material and the finance and administration section tracks expenditures makes payments and provides administrative services.

30
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:13.050
Claire Standley (she/her): As mentioned one of the benefits of IMS event, if applicable to all sorts of emergency situations, it takes an all hazards approach can be scaled to different sizes of instance, be a sub national national or even cross border or international instance.

31
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:21.420
Claire Standley (she/her): This slide provides a few examples of where I am s has been used in public health, including recently with the coven 19 pandemic.

32
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:34.950
Claire Standley (she/her): but also in lots of previous epidemics not outbreak situations and in other types of emergency medical services, requiring, for example, mass casualty events or trauma events, for example, after natural disasters such as quakes.

33
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:48.240
Claire Standley (she/her): Just as an example of how I a mess has been successfully applied is the case of Nigeria in 2014, as you will remember, in 2014.

34
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:56.430
Claire Standley (she/her): Guinea, a country in West Africa report into a case of Ebola that reported Ebola virus it's spread very quickly and in July.

35
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:13.080
Claire Standley (she/her): There was actually a case reported in Nigeria have a traveler who had come from Liberia to Lagos while the first case was reported in July 20 Nigeria was already declared free of Ebola virus 42 days after the last case was discharged.

36
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:27.630
Claire Standley (she/her): One of the reasons that Nigeria was so successful in controlling Ebola in 2014 was the infrastructure in place related to its polio program which included a national polio emergency operation Center.

37
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:39.090
Claire Standley (she/her): Then you see in Nigeria, provided a flexible management arrangement between national, international and local agencies in the private sector for rapidly detecting and responding to case the polio.

38
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:48.210
Claire Standley (she/her): Nigeria was able to successfully transition this infrastructure, the national polio year see you support the DVD outbreak.

39
00:06:50.610 --> 00:07:06.210
Claire Standley (she/her): The activities included close coordination between our partners and substantial efforts to coordinate field epidemiologists conducting contact tracing and supporting isolation in Argentina for suspected individuals who may have been exposed to Ebola virus.

40
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:15.030
Claire Standley (she/her): The activities in this case, demonstrate how quickly they were able to control the outbreak within 93 days, in contrast, unfortunately.

41
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:27.240
Claire Standley (she/her): Transmission continued for quite a lot much time longer in Liberia Guinea and Sierra Leone, the three most effective countries again demonstrating how even in a densely populated.

42
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:37.860
Claire Standley (she/her): situation like legos in the use of the ESC and application of IMS principles was very effective at controlling transmission and control, I think.

43
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:48.330
Claire Standley (she/her): In the following presentations for planning operation, logistics and finance and administration, there are more details about each of the activities that fall under these sections.

44
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.200
Claire Standley (she/her): And indeed, so much of these may overlap and be possible in more than one section.

45
00:07:52.740 --> 00:08:05.760
Claire Standley (she/her): But, overall, the key word here is the success of this response was attributed to be effective coordination mechanism provided by the already established years teaching eradicate polio in Nigeria, that was able to be transition to a new outbreak scenario.

46
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.630
Claire Standley (she/her): Another example just to quickly mention here is use if I mess in Guinea.

47
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:21.420
Claire Standley (she/her): So getting a national public health emergency operation Center was established in 2013 again as part of the West Africa Ebola response recovery efforts.

48
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:33.480
Claire Standley (she/her): In January 2017 there was a measles outbreak just acted in getting which was likely caused by interruptions to retain immunization but had occurred during the Ebola epidemic and it was declared to be a national emergency.

49
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:44.730
Claire Standley (she/her): In this case, the experience of the national level, page uc was leveraged to apply an IMS approach to coordination of the mass vaccination campaign Conakry, the capital city.

50
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:53.190
Claire Standley (she/her): And to do this they establish a temporary years see in the regional health directory so at the sub national level within it within the city of Conakry.

51
00:08:53.970 --> 00:09:02.580
Claire Standley (she/her): They created role specific terms of reference and apply them to all sections and positions again leveraging the core principles of IMS.

52
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:11.130
Claire Standley (she/her): there's also allowed them to define command communication reporting mechanisms, including daily reporting and sit REPS that came that.

53
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:21.300
Claire Standley (she/her): That were that were used to transition information from the people, conducting the vaccination campaign on the ground to those sitting in the temporary you see.

54
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:27.210
Claire Standley (she/her): The use of IMS in this case, results in more time that communication daily recording.

55
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:41.190
Claire Standley (she/her): And this also allowed for facilitation of near real time Problem Solving including overcoming obstacles such as reticence to the population receive vaccination some potential security concerns that the vaccination teams experienced and other.

56
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:48.840
Claire Standley (she/her): urgent problems that could be resolved quickly and effectively, using the IMS structure.

57
00:09:51.810 --> 00:10:03.990
Claire Standley (she/her): Here are some additional references to support further reading around this topic and the remaining presentations in this module will go into detail about each specific sections, thank you.
