1
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:17.970
Claire Standley (she/her): hi my name is Dr Claire Standley and I'm going to talk today a little bit about training and cascading in the context of strengthening public health emergency operation centers and overall public health emergency management capabilities.

2
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:32.370
Claire Standley (she/her): So training and exercises, a core part of the preparedness phase, and so the preparedness phase functions as a cycle, as many of you probably already know that ensures the regular examination of changing threats hazards and risks.

3
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.220
Claire Standley (she/her): So there's five key components to prepare the cycle there's the planning the organizing and equipping phases.

4
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.910
Claire Standley (she/her): The training then exercising and then the evaluation improvement phases

5
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.710
Claire Standley (she/her): And here we'll talk mostly about the training phase, but also to touch briefly on the exercise phase although that will be covered in more detail in another lecture.

6
00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:00.090
Claire Standley (she/her): And, of course, part of the outcomes of training include evaluations, to help improve the overall preparedness cycle, but specifically also the training components for the future.

7
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:11.550
Claire Standley (she/her): So, as I mentioned this presentation will focus on training and exercising as a way of maintaining public health emergency operation Center personnel preparedness.

8
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.850
Claire Standley (she/her): All personnel need to be trained for the positions and to receive

9
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:24.960
Claire Standley (she/her): Consistent refreshers and to be exposed to new material, as it becomes available this could include new guidance documents that either are published by international organizations such as the World Health Organization.

10
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.540
Claire Standley (she/her): By regional entities, but also from national or even sub national authorities.

11
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:41.160
Claire Standley (she/her): and sharing, ensuring that a training system or program is incorporated into the functions of preparedness phase ensures that the trainees will be able to respond to an incident again it.

12
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:51.540
Claire Standley (she/her): ensures that staff will be fully prepared to be able to fulfill their core functions, for example, within the context of an incident management system in the event of an activation.

13
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.400
Claire Standley (she/her): Part of the planning process in a PHEOC requires the development of a training program for personnel.

14
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.560
Claire Standley (she/her): A training program as opposed to having just one off or occasional trainings.

15
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.240
Claire Standley (she/her): means that a system is established for continuous training and ensures that personnel are prepared to respond and support incidents at different levels.

16
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.850
Claire Standley (she/her): at different levels of response different levels of the system and that they're prepared to change their activities, as required by those changing circumstances.

17
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:33.960
Claire Standley (she/her): Training should be available to all personnel and it should also be tailored to meet the requirements of the various positions and objectives established, for example through the concept of operations and as outlined by the PHEOC handbook.

18
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.510
Claire Standley (she/her): or other guidance documents that might be available.

19
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:48.030
Claire Standley (she/her): Within the training program for the public health emergency operation Center there also needs to be consideration of the trainers that are keeping all of the other personnel trained.

20
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.710
Claire Standley (she/her): They are essential as part of the development of the training program and determine the quality of the training received by the trainees.

21
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:07.140
Claire Standley (she/her): There are two approaches for ensuring that those who are conducting trainings and a PhD are well prepared and these are two complementary approaches I should emphasize there's cascade training and then there's training of trainers.

22
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:16.920
Claire Standley (she/her): Both approaches can be used to train a large number of individuals and, as such, are cost effective way of ensuring that all personnel in the public health emergency management system.

23
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.390
Claire Standley (she/her): are well prepared to fulfill their core roles and responsibilities.

24
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:33.900
Claire Standley (she/her): I should also note that these training requirements also applie to surge personnel so it's not just the individual working day to day, within the context of the public health emergency operation Center potentially those other individuals.

25
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:43.920
Claire Standley (she/her): who may work in other sectors and be brought in to supplement the personnel during a particularly large emergency or other volunteers that might join

26
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:57.210
Claire Standley (she/her): At a particular point in time, and so having those training programs ready and available to ensure that even search personnel understand their functions appropriately and are well equipped and begin their role is absolutely critical.

27
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.440
Claire Standley (she/her): So, with respect to the task, a training can.

28
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.460
Claire Standley (she/her): refer to a top down approach to delivering training in which a group of selected individuals are initially trained by experts.

29
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:18.120
Claire Standley (she/her): And then the knowledge is later transferred and disseminated to a different group of individuals so cascade training can be divided by stages, it was the first stage or experts training trainers.

30
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.990
Claire Standley (she/her): And the second stage, then, are those trainers training other people so again, you can already see how this complements the training trainers approach.

31
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.600
Claire Standley (she/her): And can continue for various stages and, of course, is not only limited to those two steps just mentioned.

32
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:46.380
Claire Standley (she/her): As you can see from this schematic cascade training and both delivering training through various layers of trainers until it reaches the final target group and until all the individuals that need to be targeted have received the appropriate and adequate training.

33
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.250
Claire Standley (she/her): The training of trainers approach is also quite intuitive. In this sense, it refers to the training of potential or less experienced instructors.

34
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:06.510
Claire Standley (she/her): and turning them on the best ways to deliver the training materials to the trainees and again the training of trainers can therefore be integrated with as part of your cascade trading approach.

35
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:20.520
Claire Standley (she/her): So a few key considerations for ensuring that trainers are prepared in a PHEOC are these following steps so identifying engaging with stakeholders again to identify all of the individuals that might need to be trained.

36
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.350
Claire Standley (she/her): As well as key influencers potential, you can be used to advocates of the training.

37
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.720
Claire Standley (she/her): conducting an analysis of needs of the PHEOC, with the participation of the stakeholders.

38
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:41.700
Claire Standley (she/her): identifying and communicating the outcomes of this analysis to determine what should be a priority in terms of developing the learning objectives for the training material, as well as the anticipated outcomes.

39
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:51.480
Claire Standley (she/her): Selecting top level trainers were identifying them from existing pool, or perhaps from other national or even international experts that can come provide assistance.

40
00:05:52.290 --> 00:06:05.280
Claire Standley (she/her): Identifying ongoing trainer support needs and mechanisms so again trainers themselves need access to resources to be able to successfully implement their training, so ensuring that those results those resources and the support mechanisms are available to them.

41
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.330
Claire Standley (she/her): Inserting regular evaluations, as part of the quality assurance process, so ensuring that your trainings effective and then it's actually.

42
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.450
Claire Standley (she/her): targeting the same learning objectives and outcomes that you've identified back in your analysis step.

43
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:26.520
Claire Standley (she/her): Adopting the program based on the results of the evaluations, to be back if you find that there is a mismatch now between the content of the training.

44
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:36.990
Claire Standley (she/her): and your learning objectives or the identified needs from your analysis, making those necessary adjustments and and fixing it so that you are targeting the appropriate learning objectives in the future.

45
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.910
Claire Standley (she/her): And then evaluating the achievement of outcomes so beyond just what the content of the training is.

46
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:56.760
Claire Standley (she/her): Are the participants are the trainees truly receiving the information and being able to implement the knowledge and experience that they have gained during that training successfully into their application of their role within the public health emergency management system.

47
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.640
Claire Standley (she/her): So beyond utilizing these two approaches, as part of the training Program.

48
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:10.710
Claire Standley (she/her): A training program for trainers specifically will also require desired competencies for the trainers and personnel based on established priorities.

49
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:18.540
Claire Standley (she/her): And some of these to think about could be internal communications so staff that are able to operate communication resources and technology, for example.

50
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:27.600
Claire Standley (she/her): or staff being able to conduct crisis communication and so that could be staff able to develop communication plans targeted messaging.

51
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:38.430
Claire Standley (she/her): And particularly being identified the communications needs for vulnerable groups, for example, staff should be able to perform surveillance and control activities in certain pages you contacts.

52
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.980
Claire Standley (she/her): This may mean that there are trained epidemiologists as part of your public health emergency operation Center.

53
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.560
Claire Standley (she/her): That they're able to develop case definitions or other guidelines for outbreak investigation and response.

54
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:56.640
Claire Standley (she/her): Staff may be required to collect information to integrate it and to share it appropriately within the context of the pha see.

55
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:11.160
Claire Standley (she/her): This may mean that staff have to support analysis of data or creating visualizations and dashboards to be shared, either within the eeoc and other close operational partners or even with other stakeholders that might be involved in response.

56
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:24.090
Claire Standley (she/her): and a few other considerations staff may be required, of course, to operate within an incident management and response system so again, knowing that they have pre identified roles and responsibilities to fill.

57
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:29.100
Claire Standley (she/her): They may be recalled upon to help provide coordination and logistical support.

58
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:39.750
Claire Standley (she/her): This may mean, including trained logisticians within your either your trainer khadra or indeed and logistics components within your training materials.

59
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:51.870
Claire Standley (she/her): And then staff must be able to perform yourself the exercising and the evaluation processes in some cases, it may be more efficient for smaller public health emergency operations centers to.

60
00:08:52.980 --> 00:09:00.060
Claire Standley (she/her): outsource some of their training requirements, I bring in trainers from outside, to help with these elements, however, in general, it's.

61
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:08.220
Claire Standley (she/her): cost effective and sustainable, to ensure that there is some training capacity within your own PHEOC to ensure that the.

62
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:24.810
Claire Standley (she/her): Training outcomes are closely linked to the operational needs of your particular facility or your particular public health emergency management program and so, for that reason it is important in many cases, to have at least some capacity for training inherent within your own structure.

63
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:34.680
Claire Standley (she/her): Developing clear training objectives is of course important, and particularly with respect to training trainers and other learning more generally.

64
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:47.310
Claire Standley (she/her): Incorporating diverse learning methods can be a really effective way of ensuring audience close audience engagement and maximizing the impact that your trading has on your participants.

65
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:58.980
Claire Standley (she/her): And then, finally, ensuring that there's a follow up and support system for trainees can be very important, so often we see that training is delivered and without support or follow up the content can be rapidly.

66
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:08.670
Claire Standley (she/her): diluted in the minds of participants so having both refresher opportunities to consolidate the training, perhaps also providing resources so that's.

67
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:24.450
Claire Standley (she/her): or job aids or other operational guidance for the trainings can help refresh themselves of the training content in their own facilities, but then also providing whatever resources may be needed for the trainees to successfully implement the training is also very important as well.

68
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:34.890
Claire Standley (she/her): So I mentioned exercises briefly as well, so exercises are actually a core training tool and they also can be thought of as a cycle in their own way.

69
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:41.940
Claire Standley (she/her): So each exercise has the following phases, the design and development phase, the conduct of the actual implementation of the exercise.

70
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:55.080
Claire Standley (she/her): Then there's the evaluation phase and then of course the improvement planning so once again we're seeing this as a cycle of continuous improvement, whereby each delivery of the exercise helps improve the exercise for the next time that is used.

71
00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:01.170
Claire Standley (she/her): And again, there will be another lecture specifically on exercises, but here it just suffice it to say.

72
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:07.110
Claire Standley (she/her): that there are two main categories of exercises, so there are the discussion based exercises.

73
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:16.710
Claire Standley (she/her): useful for learning and understanding plans and procedures, and then there are the more operational exercises that can be useful for practicing and evaluating response and management procedures.

74
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:25.740
Claire Standley (she/her): And again, there will also be another lecture which discusses a little bit more about these distinctions and more in more detail, and particularly with with respect to.

75
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:34.470
Claire Standley (she/her): The specific experiences of of experts who have delivered these types of exercises and in different settings and particularly in West Africa.

76
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:47.550
Claire Standley (she/her): And so, just a few examples of exercises that might be suitable for for testing validation of plan, but also of training personnel can be drills tabletop exercises functional exercises or even games.

77
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:56.760
Claire Standley (she/her): So just to wrap up, I want to provide one quick example of training for public health emergency operation centers and this comes from.

78
00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:04.470
Claire Standley (she/her): Guinea in West Africa in during the Ebola response and recovery effort, so the Ebola epidemic revealed that there were.

79
00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:11.760
Claire Standley (she/her): quite some substantial gaps with respect to public health emergency management capabilities, particularly the sub national level.

80
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:29.460
Claire Standley (she/her): And a PHEOC was established at the national level, around this time but and also regional and prefecture level EOCs were renovated and equipped and so there are the prefecture is roughly equivalent to a district so very much as the just one level above the Community.

81
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:39.600
Claire Standley (she/her): But staff who were expected to operate these EOCs didn't have training in public health emergency management and were not familiar with the principles of IMS.

82
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:48.090
Claire Standley (she/her): So our team actually collaborated with the International Organization for Migration, which had helped with the renovation and equipping of these facilities.

83
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:57.180
Claire Standley (she/her): To develop a foundational public health emergency management training program which drew from US, WHO and other international guidance materials.

84
00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:04.620
Claire Standley (she/her): And through that program we trained nine national level trainers, all of whom were Guinean and then understood the local context.

85
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:15.930
Claire Standley (she/her): Who then delivered the training across the country at five regional workshops covering every single one of the prefectures within the country that had one of these emergency operations centers that have been renovated and.

86
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:24.240
Claire Standley (she/her): So in this way, we were able to combine training of trainers with something of a cascade format to ensure that, in an efficient way.

87
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:37.800
Claire Standley (she/her): all of the personnel who would be serving in these prefecture level emergency operations centers could receive basic foundational training on public health emergency management and their role within an incident management system.

88
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.700
Claire Standley (she/her): Here are some references to help you explore this topic in more detail.

89
00:13:45.060 --> 00:14:01.500
Claire Standley (she/her): And again, as I mentioned, there will be at least a couple of additional videos that touch on exercises, including one lecture that focuses more specifically on on exercises in in further detail and here Finally a few more references for your consideration, thank you very much.
