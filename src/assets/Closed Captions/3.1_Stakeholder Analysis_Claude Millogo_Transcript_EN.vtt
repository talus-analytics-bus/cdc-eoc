00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:20.010
Claire Standley (she/her): Okay, good morning welcome Dr Claude, we are so delighted to have you here today to talk a little bit about stakeholder identification, in the context of public health and so just to get us started, could you perhaps just briefly describe your your professional background.

2
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.720
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Thank you very much. I'm so happy to be with you

3
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:36.330
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: in this initiative, I am Claude Millogo and I am a medical doctor with a university public health a diploma and

4
00:00:38.010 --> 00:01:02.190
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: I am currently the CDC and IANPHI consultant for Burkina Faso, but today I will not be speaking on behalf of CDC or the IANPHI but just I will be sharing with you my experience in supporting the NPHI [National Public Health Institute], so I have been working with

5
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:15.000
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: IANPHI, as you know IANPHI, the International Association of National Public Health Institutes. Since June 2018

6
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:29.850
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: I have been working with the Ministry of Health and other partners to set up the NPHI in Burkina Faso. Okay, and also, I have served as the emergency consultant

7
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:43.980
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: the EOC specialist for VSO for polio, the EOC specialist for VSO, and working again with the Ministry of Health and also with the

8
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.710
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: The global polio eradication initiative partners

9
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.600
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: and

10
00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:10.980
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: I have been working in the field of public health for over 20 years with the government of the US, but in Burkina Faso and before joining IANPHI I

11
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:30.120
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: was the associate Peace Corps director here in Burkina Faso and supporting, helping, assisting the country director to develop and monitor, to implement, monitor and evaluate their community health.
12
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.920
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: And before that I was with USAID and UNICEF too, so I will stop here.

13
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.060
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: For my background.

14
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.540
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Thank you.

15
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:48.180
Claire Standley (she/her): I can see how it could take a long time to go through all of the many things that you've accomplished across your career, so thank you for that brief overview.

16
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.170
Claire Standley (she/her): So so with respect to helping to set up Burkina is Burkina Faso's national public health institutes.

17
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:07.770
Claire Standley (she/her): And I know it's a relatively recent institution, so perhaps you could just briefly describe what the motivation for setting up the Institute was and and some of the context around that process.

18
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.070
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Okay, as you know, the Ebola epidemic.

19
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:39.570
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Yes, it was really highlighting the urgent need to work to strengthen the national public health systems and in Burkina Faso, there was also the need to consolidate existing public health functions into a single entity to oversee disease control and response, the public health functions were scattered.

20
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:51.390
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: So it was important to really consolidate them and there was also a need to provide it, timely and evidence based response to public health issues

21
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.000
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: and

22
00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:13.440
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: And the establishment, the creation of the yes, the NPHI it also fits into the launch by the heads of the states of the African Union to establish the African CDC and establish National Public Health Institutes in each Member States.

23
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.320
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: So the main objective of the creation of the Burkina

24
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:34.260
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: NPHI it the same for the other NPHIs as it is to meet the needs of strengthening health systems and the management for measuring health risks in public health and to support the global health security agenda right.

25
00:04:35.460 --> 00:05:02.160
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: So it is very important to mention in that context the the high political will in Burkina Faso to establish the NPHI and the NPHI is even listed as a priority in the presidential program, so this is something important, and it was a great opportunity, how ever.

26
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:24.720
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: the Burkina NPHI was not established over night, the initiative to create such an institution has germinated since '98, imagine, also and finally happened in 2018 and it was created by a presidential decree.

27
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.460
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: by the President of the State.

28
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.100
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: that's very important to underline.

29
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:43.680
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: The different national recognition and the NPHI is a public institution operating as part of the government and within the Ministry of Health.

30
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:45.540
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: That is for.

31
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.570
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: The context of creation.

32
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.210
Claire Standley (she/her): And 20 years to get to this point, wonderful.

33
00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:03.630
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: We met in the beginning, I met with both people who really were the how to say the initiators.

34
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:14.310
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: They talked about it and start talking and discussing how to implement it, it was impressive how difficult to establish the NPHI yeah.

35
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:34.230
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: And to answer the question on which ministries, sectors and partner were involved, as you see, in addition to the President, who signed on it, in addition to the Ministry of Health, who sign on it, Minister of Health, in addition to the Minister of financial.

36
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.680
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: will sign on the decree.

37
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:48.000
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Important ministry involved in the establishment of the NPHI is the ministry in charge of research.

38
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.160
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Simply because.

39
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:57.180
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: NPHI includes three research centers.

40
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:11.100
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: That were merged into the NPHI it was important, so the Ministry of Research was obviously involved, but in reality, the approach was.

41
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:28.950
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: inclusive yeah I would say that the entire was was involved, since they discussed in the Council of Ministers, the establishment was discussed in the Council of Ministers before.

42
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.110
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: And they all agree and and then the decree was signed.

43
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.480
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: say that the entire government.

44
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.430
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Was it was involved in that this is something that is important too.

45
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:47.130
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: So two partners also were highly involved 

46
00:07:48.450 --> 00:08:00.330
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: In the creation of the NPHI so to mention key partners who were involved, I consider US CDC and IANPHI.

47
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:12.900
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: has supported the NPHI since the beginning for technical guidance and advice and financial support. Even the EOC 

48
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:23.070
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: itself was even renovated, equipped and the staff trained by the US CDC so and other partners were also involved.

49
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.580
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: partners who.

50
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.970
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Yes, and also WAHO.

51
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:42.390
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Wolrd bank and, yes, the the partners were very supportive to the establishment of the NPHI.

52
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:44.460
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Other.

53
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.800
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: key element key.

54
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:54.390
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: People or structures that were involved were well established NPHIs also yeah and.

55
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:04.140
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: IANPHI has a well established network, and it has a well functioning approach for peer to peer support.

56
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.630
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: So yes, the NPHI.

57
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:22.650
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: For example, in SantÃ© Publique de France,Science a no, in Belgium, these are the other NPHIs that have really supported and were involved, also in the operationalization of the NPHI I think yeah.

58
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:31.230
Claire Standley (she/her): Great and and with respect you know, obviously the NPHI is a national level Institute in Burkina Faso, but.

59
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:45.540
Claire Standley (she/her): Did you have any engagement, also with sub national entities at the state, province, or the prefecture level in terms of understanding how the NPHI would play a role in public health across the whole country.

60
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.490
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Yes.

61
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.930
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Yes, among the stakeholders some, of course, there will be some national level.

62
00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:07.350
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Yes, and the "collectivitÃ©s" is the local administrations, and the regional directorates of health.

63
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:14.010
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: The districts, and to the Community, and it is important that even the Community.

64
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:28.320
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: level is involved, we cannot do anything at the national levels if the structures that are in charge to implement and are not involved So yes, they were absolutely involved.

65
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:35.040
Claire Standley (she/her): And so, in your role is sort of gathering all of these different partners and stakeholders.

66
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:48.690
Claire Standley (she/her): Did you find that there were specific strategies that you used to bring them on board or to get their support, considering that there are many different types of stakeholders that you mentioned, from the World Bank to the.

67
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.140
Claire Standley (she/her): Community you know, this is a big range.

68
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.460
yeah.

69
00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:19.500
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Since the beginning, and the NPHI Burkina Faso felt it's crucial to identify and engage the stakeholders, and we consider as stakeholders every organization or individuals that have interest in the work of the NPHI and/or all can help the NPHI achieve its mission so.

70
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:21.960
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: We need.

71
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.830
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: To, we need a synergy.

72
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:39.600
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: We need positive influence will also to reduce negative influence and we need to engage stakeholders for greater impact.

73
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.120
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: So that's it.

74
00:11:47.730 --> 00:12:01.740
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: that's stage we wanted, through the stakeholder identification and engagement to obtain support for the NPHI.

75
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.050
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: to obtain ownership.

76
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:09.810
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Of the NPHI, we needed ownership.

77
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.460
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Thta's important

78
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:22.140
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: This is not something that is just for Burkina Faso, so it is your NPHI and we want to that, and it was important also to mobilize resources for.

79
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:34.380
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: The operationalization of the NPHI so that's where the key reason why we need to really to focus on the stakeholder identification. 

80
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:36.660
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: yeah.

81
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:46.140
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: It was important to focus on organizations that were supporting.

82
00:12:48.960 --> 00:13:06.060
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: It was also important to focus on those who have negative influence, because, of course, the emphasis was the new structure and people could see that maybe there is a competition.

83
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.830
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: In what they have been doing.

84
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:22.890
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: So it was important to bring those people on board, with the help of those who are already supportive we needed them to bring on board those who are hesitant or considered the NPHI as a.

85
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:31.620
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: As a hindrance to the world or competing competing with them and we need.

86
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.380
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: to also take that into consideration.

87
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.410
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: We need to categorize them.

88
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:52.230
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: categorize how? First the government entities, we need to this is a category and, within that category, you have those within the Ministry of Health.

89
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:59.250
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: And we have those in the government but are not within the Ministry of Health.

90
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:07.230
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Okay, for example, the Ministry of research, I said, the Ministry of.

91
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.640
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: in charge of media all those

92
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:18.090
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: People yeah we needed to really focus on those to identify them and.

93
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:19.800
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: focus.

94
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.390
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: On those also and.

95
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:33.600
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: we spoke about government right and we also in the spirit of the One Health.

96
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:58.320
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: This is a key point for the NPHI jBurkina Faso where we have to focus also and to include that in that group of government, all the ministries in charge of agriculture, of livestock, of environment, of obviously these groups, they needed to be in that group.

97
00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:05.010
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: And, given the security issue also in Burkina it was important to.

98
00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.020
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: include the military's etc those groups, yes.

99
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.060
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Yes.

100
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:18.120
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: So a lot of categories, a platform, the government of course.

101
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:34.830
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: partners, the International Organization providing technical and financial support and World Bank, USAID, even though they were involved with the key stakeholders.

102
00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.820
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: And another category is the.

103
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.180
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: How do you call the private sector.

104
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:57.330
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: yeah the private sector organization that was wanting, including these people talking with them, you can see that they want to help, and they even do not know how to help, so these people was very important to.

105
00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:14.010
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: include and of course academics, the civil society, the civil society, the media, etc. you know civil society let's say that in Burkina Faso, we are lucky to have a very strong

106
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.740
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Civil society with.

107
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:35.790
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: With associations of youth, of women and agriculturalists, all these people from top to bottom, so they are well-structured and it were important to involve them.

108
00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:42.420
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: into our stakeholders other key people of the faith

109
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:52.950
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Opinion leader and yeah and yeah and they they're particularly were happy to be considered as a stakeholder.

110
00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:56.040
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: For the NPHI

111
00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:57.900
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: So.

112
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:11.640
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: What was our approach to identifying exactly the groups, how do you get good at categorize them, so what was our approach.

113
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.920
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: For example, a little reading the documents through reading the documents we realized that.

114
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:35.490
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: There were groups of people who were established to think about the NPHI to analyze the situation and the social impact the etc, so this group of people, of course, important to include in the.

115
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:45.750
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Our stakeholders, they were key, in fact, because they have all the background they can explain things to the others, so that they can.

116
00:17:47.700 --> 00:18:01.680
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: be on board and document reading and also approaching those structures who were involved in the in the creation of the NPHI

117
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:21.660
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: meaning the Minister himself the Minister himself and his structures and talking with with the Minister of Health and asking according to you who are the other stakeholders that we need to to approach and.

118
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:35.910
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: cite the people, and we will list them in something when we are talking with the people who established the group that the NPHI, same question according to you, who are other.

119
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:55.140
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: stakeholders that have interest in the NPHI, they would decide it those who are supportive and said also those who are tempted to say no, we don't need an NPHI in that country so that was very, very useful and.

120
00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:16.710
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Yes, asking question etc. Now to approach them we did one on one conversation with people we did focus group discussion and also we had stakeholder workshop, and we had partners Roundtable.

121
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:18.660
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: You know.

122
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:24.570
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: So yeah and the one on one discussion with people.

123
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:37.710
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: We wanted to listen to them and they wanted to express themselves, they really liked that you think they wanted to talk and see what they think about the NPHI.

124
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:50.460
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: I was, I went for 15 to 20 minutes of discussion and I found myself discussing for one hour even sometimes for two hours because people want to express themselves.

125
00:19:50.760 --> 00:20:12.210
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: yeah we are yeah me just ask them about a establishment of the NPHI, their concerns what they think the NPHI will bring to their structure and vice versa, and if they had suggestion, so that they.

126
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.430
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: can be.

127
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:41.700
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: operational and things like that, so they really liked that we and we we we summarize all these things, then what they said their concerns, what the NPHI can offer to to to the Ministry, to the government to them, etc, we went with a document on that and we presented that at the.

128
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.860
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: stakeholder workshop

129
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.800
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: They really discussed it.

130
00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:55.800
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Their concern, of course, we presented that to the leadership of the NPHI and the Ministry of Health hey These are the things.

131
00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:16.770
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: that people are saying about the NPHI, these are their concern and so they came to the counterpart workshop with some of the answers and we let the stakeholder themselves come up with their idea on how to overcome the challenges that the NPHI could meet.

132
00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:23.040
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Yes, and that was really interesting and.

133
00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:32.160
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: At the stakeholder workshop again, as I said at the beginning, really wanted there buy-in.

134
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.240
Claire Standley (she/her): yeah.

135
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:52.350
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: We wanted their ownership of it, we wanted their ideas on how to handle the establishment of the NPHI and we got that. And people were happy to participate and tell us what they wanted to do.

136
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.890
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Okay, so, and then the Roundtable partners Roundtable we had.

137
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:12.960
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Two partners roundtables so far and we are planning others. The first one again it was to explain to them, where we were, what the NPHI was doing.

138
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:30.630
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: What are the achievement so far etc and the second one was really to brainstorm to discuss with them what they can bring to the NPHI and what the NPHI can offer to them.

139
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.260
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: In the win, win approach.

140
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:35.820
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Yes, was very important.

141
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.100
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: The NPHI had to explain.

142
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:46.890
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Their strengths, what they can do they have laboratories, they have a researcher, they have very high level people.

143
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:55.380
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: They explain to the stakeholder what they bring to the table and vice versa.

144
00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:57.480
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Yes.

145
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:05.220
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: So this is what I would say, related to the approach. 

146
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:12.330
Claire Standley (she/her): And it sounds I think a piece, I just want to follow up on is, you mentioned that there will be more partner 

147
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.350
Claire Standley (she/her): meetings and you.

148
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:20.730
Claire Standley (she/her): Know stakeholder identification is is one piece, but, of course, then there's the maintenance of the relationships right.

149
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:32.160
Claire Standley (she/her): Could you speak a little bit to how the mph I and and perhaps even specifically the PHEOC continues to engage these different stakeholders and how that communication and coordination.

150
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.010
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Yes, I for what important is in addition to.

151
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:48.840
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: To the one on one meeting with stakeholders in addition to the stakeholder workshop and roundtable we went to the organization, for example.

152
00:23:49.590 --> 00:24:07.290
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: We went to do so, all in the office all the staff was there and again we discussed with them, and you know the WHO person would say Oh, maybe I do not have funds for you.

153
00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.370
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: And i'll say.

154
00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:14.670
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Oh, we do not need funds from you, we need your influence you can influence people.

155
00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:31.620
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: yeah and yeah and she directed etc, the representative she did a great job whenever people are gathered they will say hey do not forget forget the NPHI that can do this, and this, and this that was fantastic.

156
00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:41.520
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: And where do we begin the people like that the organization structure before leaving we asked for the name and the contact of the point person.

157
00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:42.030
yeah.

158
00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:53.220
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: And then the discussion continues with that one person, the partners, we did that, with the partner we did that, with the government social also the hospitals, etc.

159
00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:54.690
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: yeah.

160
00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:00.810
Claire Standley (she/her): Very cool and so, then that allows you to have that sustained communication with.

161
00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:02.700
Claire Standley (she/her): stakeholders.

162
00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.980
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Here there are the news newsletter there are there is the.

163
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:11.790
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Facebook.

164
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:31.650
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: yeah facebook, the website etc yeah you can go to the to the website and see what the NPHI is doing, you can see, the strategic plan, you can see the dashboard etc So these are these all these things are communicating the stakeholders in fact yeah.

165
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:46.920
Claire Standley (she/her): yeah so last question for you just quickly you know, based on your experiences what advice would you give to an EOC, a public health EOC that's trying to engage more with stakeholders in its in its region or country.

166
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.860
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: To tell you the truth, I asked the question to our EOC Director.

167
00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:05.670
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: I went to him and asked him what would you recommend and he said Okay, yes, the national level is the coordination level.

168
00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:19.470
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: yeah is where is the strategic level the coordination level, you really need to engage the sub national level until the Community that is what he said and.

169
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:30.660
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: He also said that documentation written documents specific specifying role and responsibilities at all level is key.

170
00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:32.970
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: And this is was.

171
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:44.010
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: One of his suggestions and recommendations. and he also said that yes, training of course, is important and I forgot that part.

172
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.570
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: It is not enough to involve people, you need to train them.

173
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:49.650
To.

174
00:26:51.630 --> 00:27:01.710
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: The sub national level, for example, they were waiting on emergency management etc so training also is important, what.

175
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.680
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: I could say.

176
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.290
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Best practice.

177
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:12.600
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: According to him, it was the involvement of the military.

178
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:22.440
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: yeah the military is so that they can access  the zone, the areas with security issues.

179
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.130
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: For invetsigation, they were they were.

180
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:50.100
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: very helpful on that and they even created RRT team, a rapid response team within the army, yes, so to deal with the military camps and the lab, because they have medical structure, they have labs, the military structures so the lab also participated in the in the, for example.

181
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.700
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: In the management of the COVID-19.

182
00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.840
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: yeah yeah and what else.

183
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.320
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: They involved, maybe not only the.

184
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.940
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Traditional people structure, but they really did think out of the box.

185
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.200
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: In a.

186
00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:24.660
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: situation, what are the group that really need to be involved, for example, the, the body in charge of the government body in charge of humanitarian response.

187
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:33.840
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: yeah I was, IT people, yes, of course, it is currently we cannot do anything without.

188
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:43.050
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: IT. And again, at least for the Burkina Faso context, the faith and opportune leaders

189
00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:52.920
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: yeah, if you want your Community members to accept the measure some time, it is hard on them.

190
00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.320
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: You need to go through the faith and opportune leaders.

191
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:59.460
Claire Standley (she/her): yeah yeah.

192
00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:15.900
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: And it shows in the most success if the iman and the leader say Oh, you know that it is difficult, this, but it is important for us to start distancing etc, etc, people will understand it and follow.

193
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.650
millogoclaude@yahoo.fr: Yes, this is what he told me as suggestion ideas.

194
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:29.160
Claire Standley (she/her): Well, thank you so much, and please thank him as well on on our behalf for his input to this.
