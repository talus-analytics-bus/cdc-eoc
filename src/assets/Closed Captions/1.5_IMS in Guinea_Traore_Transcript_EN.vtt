1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.620
Claire Standley (she/her): So thank you so much i'm truly delighted to be able to welcome today, Dr Amadou Traore

2
00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:23.970
Claire Standley (she/her): And longtime colleague and collaborator and a public health emergency management experts will be talking to us about his experiences and implementing incident management systems in various phases, but specifically in in Guinea so.

3
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.900
Claire Standley (she/her): Amadou, thank you so much for being here. To get us started, could you please briefly describe your background and training in public health emergency management.

4
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:50.790
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Thank you it's a pleasure to be here to take part in this session and, as you said, my name is Amadou Traore, I am a bi-national from Guinea and also Britain.

5
00:00:51.240 --> 00:01:02.610
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: My degree is in medicine and from the University of Gamal in Guinea, I also have masters' degrees in public health studies and biomedical science from the UK.

6
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:15.720
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: And I am a certified FETP Frontline fellow and also, I have attended an emergency management program fellow in fellowship in in the US in Atlanta.

7
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:25.230
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: And so I have been mostly I mean, most recently involved in public health emergency management capacity in Guinea.

8
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:36.690
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: So I will be pretty much happy to talk to you about that, because my experience is actually span of IHR core capacity building and the GHSA.

9
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:48.090
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: and in terms of preparedness emergency response operations linking public health and security authorities, also medical countermeasures and.

10
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:59.640
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: personnel deployment and risk communication, so I also assume some coordination rules in terms of public public health risk assessment, using, for example, WHO VRAM

11
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:08.940
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: vulnerability and risk assessment mapping, the strategic tool for the assessment of risk and also the CDC.

12
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.470
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: THIRA, which is the threat and hazard identification and risk assessment so also involved in the.

13
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:33.600
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Management of some exercise program especially tabletop exercise real full scale simulation exercise that both national and regional level, so this is really a brief, probably seems to be a bit long but to give you a good.

14
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.460
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Exposure to the scope of my activities, thank you.

15
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.780
Claire Standley (she/her): Well, I think it just reflects the the depth of your experience in this field, so thank you so much for providing that overview.

16
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:56.760
Claire Standley (she/her): So so based on your experiences, as you say, across different settings, what are the benefits the practical benefits of using a system like IMS to to coordinate response.

17
00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.550
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: hey um.

18
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:10.950
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Let me just maybe jog my memory back to the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Guinea let's say in West Africa in 2014 and 16.

19
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:24.960
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: So this was a large outbreak and that affected the mostly three countries, including Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, in terms of the management of that emergency there were a lot of.

20
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.870
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Actually, his heels in terms of.

21
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:40.020
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: The coordination and also the communication, however, with the experience of CDC and using IMS in in in in in managing some other event.

22
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:49.920
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: I think that experience was leveraging Guinea and help actually manage very well the outbreak in terms of the coordination and the communication.

23
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:58.950
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: So definitely some of these advantages would definitely be effective management in terms of coordination and you know communication.

24
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:09.570
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Additionally, we also can using the IMS achieve in effective use of scarce resources, especially you know for poor settings.

25
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:22.950
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: And also, it allows you know common operating pictures and manageable span of control, whereas we have one single person not responsible for no more than seven people.

26
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:34.140
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: And, which is a it is really some of the main advantages that we've seen in Guinea, and it has resulted in a in a good outcome for the management team, or just in general.

27
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.210
Claire Standley (she/her): Thank you yeah I think those those concrete examples are very helpful.

28
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:52.350
Claire Standley (she/her): And so, so going into that a bit more deeply what are some of the challenges, then of implementing a system, you know I think if it was easy we'd see them all over the place, but but, of course, there must be some difficulties or challenges that we need to be overcome.

29
00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:04.200
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Yes, certainly there are challenges, and you know as for every new system that you want to implement in your countries.

30
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.720
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: I mean, first of all, you will face some difficulties in terms of implementing.

31
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:20.700
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: I mean, because the leadership the management will be not welcoming at first because it's a new system that they are not used to it they have

32
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.740
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Probably other experiences, they want to carry on using those experiences.

33
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:38.070
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: So the first time, when we started implementing IMS people said Oh, this is a new structure, it would be like a parallel system, how can we really ensure that we achieve this.

34
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:51.660
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: This principle of IMS and EOC in a broader sense, so one of the the the advice that I gave coming freshly from Atlanta was, we will not be.

35
00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:00.570
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Using the system as such as it is used in the US, but we'll add that into our own context, so I use that.

36
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:11.880
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: expression to try and convince the leadership at the time to accept using it, so instead of creating new structure in terms of the EOC and also the implementation of the IMS.

37
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:20.400
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: I say let's assign the functions of the EOC and the IMS to staff already on the payroll with the government.

38
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:30.480
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: So that's one of the challenges that we had the opposition from the leadership, and the second challenge is also in terms of resources to,

39
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:51.180
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Especially financial resources to train staff, and you know not many people are trained in terms of using IMS so every single time you want to prevent IMS we face people basically by having difficulties in immersing into the depth of this this tool.

40
00:06:52.350 --> 00:07:02.850
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: yeah and, yes, so the adaptation to Guinea was quite a good experience, and I think some countries, you know are struggling.

41
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:12.030
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Because when you're recruiting new staff, you have to think about you know the funder resources to pay them, whereas in Guinea.

42
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:27.120
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: You know why it is working perfectly right now in the district is because we use the staff already there and who actually just performing these functions of the IMS in in in the district.

43
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:34.230
Claire Standley (she/her): yeah well, and you know I think you mentioned the training so obviously one of the objectives of.

44
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:44.190
Claire Standley (she/her): This interview is that we're helping to provide more training materials so you are contributing hopefully to expanding the availability of of training resources for IMS across the world.

45
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:54.360
Claire Standley (she/her): And you mentioned the district so that's a great jumping point, I think, could you speak a little bit to your experience of implementing IMS at the sub national level and how that's gone.

46
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:10.440
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Right, yes, before I answer that let me just say you're quite right in terms of you know, conducting training to make sure that we popularized this system, and you know very.

47
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.140
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Large large scale.

48
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:21.390
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: And you know performing also training for the leadership is very important let's not forget that, because.

49
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:31.890
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: They are the one that we want to seek them by in if they don't they're not convinced they they will not be willing to support the activities so that's why.

50
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:42.090
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: First of all, I mean we need to include in our training program the leadership executive training for public health emergency management, including principles of EOC.

51
00:08:42.480 --> 00:09:02.670
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: operations and also the use of IMS and also the the the importance of the IMS and I think this was proven in my experience, I mean the the importance of the the IMS when we tried to implement this at the district level, and you are quite right in asking that question, I can.

52
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:11.280
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Remember that during the measles outbreak in Guinea in 2027, 2017.

53
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.640
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: I think that was just after we had.

54
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.850
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: come out of a long battle against.

55
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:34.200
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: EVD, Ebola virus disease outbreak, and we we actually were facing issues in terms of managing effectively the measles outbreak, because many districts were having sporadic cases of measles.

56
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:45.540
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: And so, at one point in time, the Ministry of Health declared the emergency which was on the eighth of February, if my memory is not failing.

57
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:57.120
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: 2017 and so following that we said okay Why not use this opportunity to show the goods of the IMS use.

58
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:11.520
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: So that maybe the leadership will accept the principles of the EOC so we actually staged an EOC at the sub national level in Conakry, Conakry is the capital city of Guinea and.

59
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:26.940
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: The direction de la sante de la ville de Conakry, which is a regional level, so the entity, where we actually had to pull in you know staff from the EOC including trained.

60
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:39.630
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: a trained fellow from the US CDC to activate the IMS system, so all the functions were activated, including the liaison officer, the.

61
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:51.750
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Communication officer, which is just an adaptation from the public information officer and also the security officer and then we had also this operational section, like the.

62
00:10:52.620 --> 00:11:03.120
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Operation section chief we had a logistics chief and also implemented a activated the the planning section, and also the.

63
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:17.220
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Human resources, financial administration so basically as a result of this, some of the benefit, I will not go into details, there's a very total report I may share with you later, but some of the benefit of this was.

64
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:26.460
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: I w ill single out for example, the fact that previously during the mass campaign of vaccinations

65
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:39.600
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: people had to wait till very late in the afternoon, sometimes they could stay up until 9pm to wait for reports from the field and then be able to.

66
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:48.840
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: start now thinking about how to address some of the gaps or issues that have been identified in the field, yet, with the implementation of the IMS.

67
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:59.940
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: What was happening, all issues were reported in real time and also address, and then, if they could not be addressed at the EOC that was staged at the DDSCO

68
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:12.720
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: There were escalated to the leadership level to find solution so which resulted really in a very positive outcome, as you know, the even we saw some kind of improvement in terms of the.

69
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:28.020
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: The vaccination coverage, so the IMS was then  a huge success at the time, and as a result, the Director of the the ANSS in Guinea actually said okay we're going to.

70
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:45.510
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: set EOCs at all districts to be able to help the management of outbreak. So yes, and I think you know identity is really have have been actually seen throughout the implementation of the.

71
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.430
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: The the the EOC, the IMS at the DDSCO.

72
00:12:52.230 --> 00:13:02.160
Claire Standley (she/her): Fantastic and, just to clarify for our listeners the aisense is the national health security agency and getting which was established during the Ebola response actually in has now become the lead.

73
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.340
Claire Standley (she/her): Implementing agency for all health security and International Health Regulations related activities.

74
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:17.430
Claire Standley (she/her): yeah, so I think just you know i'm really interested by by the description of how positive the lessons.

75
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:26.760
Claire Standley (she/her): How positive an experience it was at the sub national level in terms of improving coordination and response and and I think it also highlights nicely, the idea that.

76
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:40.140
Claire Standley (she/her): EOCs and particularly the IMS structure can be used, of course, for outbreak response but also potentially in the future for mass vaccination campaigns in a more routine way, so I think that's something really positive to take from this.

77
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:48.660
Claire Standley (she/her): And, are there any final lessons learned that you'd share from from either your national level or your your sub national level experience of implementing IMS.

78
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:50.940
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Yes.

79
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.030
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: What I can see is that.

80
00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:00.180
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: You know, when you take the IHR core capacities, I mean the IHR.

81
00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:02.970
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: International Health Regulations

82
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:15.840
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: They enjoin Member member countries actually to develop this capacity to be able to to prevent, detect and respond to an emergency or national or international concern.

83
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:24.960
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: So really all countries should really engage in building those capacity to be able to prepare for to prevent from respond to.

84
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:34.830
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: And also mitigate the risk or effect of public health emergency of national or international concern so as part of the preparation, really.

85
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:45.450
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: We have to develop these tools and ensure that we train staff so when the IMS was have been implemented in Guinea and that the beneficial was shown not only.

86
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:54.660
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Throughout the response to Ebola but also when we moved into responding to measles we implemented the IMS at the.

87
00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:03.990
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: DDSCO because some of these benefit that we're seeing actually was an incentive is it actually was a driving force behind the.

88
00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:15.480
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Implementation of the IMS at the district level so with the support of partners, I would not want to cite any one of them so that, for fear of leaving some more out.

89
00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:25.740
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: But definitely we created the EOC with the IMS function at the district level and what we have seen is.

90
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:31.530
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: That, for example in terms of data collection in terms of reporting information from the field.

91
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:41.850
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: And there is all the tools, the templates were developed and they get all given to the district, for example, the SitRep, the situational awareness, is a report on.

92
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:59.400
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: How basically the, the situation is being managed or being dealt with from the from the district level, so it also gives some kind of authority to the district and not allow you know the national level to always move whenever there is an emergency, so you are given some kind of.

93
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:17.040
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: authority and also some kind of autonomy to the district, to be the first responders and to be able to manage and then only request assistance from the national level when they are overwhelmed and we have seen this and really I think there was a resurgence of.

94
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.600
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: EVD in Guinea in 2020.

95
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:33.870
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Basically, in February and also recently a Marburg case also was detected in the Forest Region, and the districts actually used some of these principles, and they were going to.

96
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:48.690
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: carry out this coordination meeting and also use the SitReps fill them and send them to the national level and which actually alleviate the burden of the national level activity, because if you were to have in a large massive.

97
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:55.410
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: outbreak, if you were to actually collate, all the the the field data.

98
00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:03.990
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: It will be wouldn't become really, really, really tedious so the fact that they are able to fill this information in an international level, we can only.

99
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:13.740
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: Trying to do a summary report that we can share with stakeholders and the leadership and also some of these supporting partners.

100
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:26.610
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: And that was really a very, very good, positive outcome, so, in a nutshell, I think the IMS has been a good experience in Guinea and as a result, I think.

101
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:41.100
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: As a result, of developing the tools and of these plans, some of the neighbors actually also always use the example of Guinea to implement the IMS structure in their country, one of them, I can think of is Mali.

102
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:52.050
Sierra Leone Dr Amadou Traore: What I have my colleagues who have also said they want to actually you know implement the IMS and the EOC principles in their country, the same way it has been in Guinea.

103
00:17:53.910 --> 00:18:04.110
Claire Standley (she/her): Fantastic Thank you so much, and, of course, you know that mentioning relieving pressure on a national level was especially important with COVID-19 happening in the background right, so the.

104
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:11.310
Claire Standley (she/her): National EOC was, of course, very busy dealing with the pandemic and national level implementation of control measures and so.

105
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:17.670
Claire Standley (she/her): It was even more important that the districts were able to take charge and manage successfully those.

106
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:29.970
Claire Standley (she/her): resurgence of Ebola that you mentioned, and of course the Marburg case so again showing how it's important, especially when there's limited resources human or financial to have that hierarchy of management right.
