00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.800
(Claire Standley) Hello, my name is Claire Standley, and I’m an Assistant Research Professor

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.200
from the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University.

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.240
(Jim Banaski) And I am Jim Banaski, a Public Health Emergency Management Specialist

6
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.600
at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

7
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.160
(Claire Standley) This video provides a brief overview of emergency management

8
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.680
as a set of principles and associated tools that can be used to support

9
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.640
public health responses, such as management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

10
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.120
We will also introduce you to some of the resources available on this website

11
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.000
to help build or strengthen emergency management capabilities.

12
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.320
(Jim Banaski) First of all, what do we mean by the term “emergency management”?

13
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.240
The term “emergency management” describes the organization and management of resources

14
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.320
and responsibilities associated with all aspects of emergencies,

15
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.720
including before and after the response efforts.

16
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.800
These different stages are sometimes referred to as the emergency management cycle,

17
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.120
and include mitigation (sometimes also called prevention), preparedness,

18
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.520
response, and recovery. These stages can also overlap,

19
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.440
with mitigation activities coinciding with preparedness, for example,

20
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.840
or recovery efforts starting even while a response is underway.

21
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.000
(Jim Banaski) A core principle of emergency management is the use

22
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.440
of standardized management structure that allows for a common

23
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.920
understanding of roles, responsibilities, and processes.

24
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.920
One such management structure, which is internationally recognized as a best practice,

25
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.560
is called the incident management system, or IMS.

26
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.320
IMS, based on the principals of the Incident Command System and other

27
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.400
similar management structures, are designed to encompass a number of key attributes,

28
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.920
including a standardized and unified command structure, management by objectives,

29
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.520
modular organization, and an emphasis on incident action planning, among others.

30
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.640
These attributes enhance organization, communication, and coordination,

31
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.400
while maintaining effective accountability.

32
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.120
(Jim Banaski) Emergency operations centers are the control facilities

33
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.960
responsible for carrying out the functions of emergency management.

34
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.320
In the most basic sense, they serve as centralized sites for coordination

35
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.400
of resources, information, and communication during response efforts.

36
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.200
EOCs are made of three core elements: infrastructure, personnel, and processes.

37
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.680
The infrastructure of an EOC relates to its physical location, design, and equipment.

38
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.280
The personnel is the staff required to manage its operations.

39
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.320
The processes are the systems and procedures through which the EOC operates,

40
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.480
both in times of emergencies as well as during peacetime.

41
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.240
(Jim Banaski) EOCs are organized using a management structure

42
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.400
like IMS. Outside of emergencies,

43
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.920
many EOC staff serve in other functions.

44
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.320
During the mitigation and preparedness phases,

45
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.320
they may be required to complete refresher trainings,

46
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.640
contribute to the development or review of plans,

47
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.760
or participate in simulation exercises to practice

48
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.120
those plans and hone their readiness.

49
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.160
Once there is an alert of a possible emergency,

50
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.160
the EOC is “activated,” and the staff take up their response roles

51
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.720
within the EOC’s IMS framework.

52
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.160
The overall response is managed by the incident manager,

53
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.760
who oversees separate units in charge of planning, operations,

54
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.000
logistics, and finance and administration, as well as other

55
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.680
specialized roles such as safety, public relations,

56
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.080
and liaisons with other organizations or outside entities.

57
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.560
When the response concludes, the EOC can be deactivated again,

58
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.040
and staff resume their normal duties.

59
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.680
(Jim Banaski) EOCs, and the emergency management principles and structures

60
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.920
that support them, have been demonstrated to be powerful tools

61
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.640
for supporting emergency response across all sorts of disasters and crises.

62
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.440
Public health emergencies are no exception.

63
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.840
The core principles of planning and preparation, management of supplies and resources,

64
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.800
and ensuring clear lines of communication and accountability,

65
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.640
both internally and outward to the public,

66
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.680
are critical tools for supporting public health responses.

67
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.000
For example, in 2014, Nigeria’s public health EOC,

68
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.560
which had originally been established to help coordinate the polio eradication effort,

69
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.440
proved to be an extremely important tool in helping to manage contact tracing

70
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.920
and case management when the Ebola virus disease was introduced from Liberia.

71
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.520
In the end, despite global fears of Ebola spreading unchecked in Lagos,

72
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.320
the Nigerian Ministry of Health, coordinating its efforts through the EOC,

73
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.320
was able to respond incredibly quickly on transmission

74
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.320
and limit the total number of cases to only 20, with fewer than 10 deaths.

75
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.720
(Claire Standley) The current COVID-19 pandemic is an example

76
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.760
of a globally relevant public health response that can benefit

77
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.560
from the application of emergency management principles,

78
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.320
and the use of an emergency operations center to coordinate response efforts.

79
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.640
As a reminder, COVID-19 was first reported in December, 2019, by the Chinese government

80
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.800
as a cluster of unusual pneumonia cases in Hubei province,

81
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.080
centered around the city of Wuhan.

82
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.200
Within just a few weeks, the number of cases escalated extremely rapidly,

83
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.480
and on January 30, the World Health Organization declared the epidemic to be

84
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.960
a “public health emergency of international concern."

85
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.400
Despite China quickly implementing strict control measures,

86
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.240
including a full lockdown in the city of Wuhan,

87
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.200
the virus had already spread to other parts of the world,

88
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.200
in part due to individuals being able to transmit the virus prior to experiencing any symptoms.

89
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.480
Large numbers of cases were soon being reported from countries

90
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.480
like Iran, Italy, Spain, and France.

91
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.600
On March 11, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.

92
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.160
To date, as of May 12, there have been almost 4.2 million confirmed cases of COVID-19

93
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.720
and over 268,000 deaths across the world,

94
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.440
with about two-thirds of the total cases reported from just six countries:

95
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.720
the USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

96
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.520
(Claire Standley) The rapid spread and severity of the disease in some individuals,

97
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.120
in particular the elderly and those with underlying health conditions,

98
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.040
has prompted most countries to pursue strategies to try

99
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.280
to ensure their healthcare systems are not overwhelmed.

100
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.040
The fundamental approach for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic

101
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.400
remains the tried and tested tools of public health response: identify affected individuals,

102
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.040
monitor them (and isolate or quarantine as necessary),

103
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.640
and trace and monitor their contacts,

104
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.760
while preventing infections in healthcare settings.

105
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.000
However, the scale of the pandemic has required most countries to adopt

106
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.280
substantial additional measures to prevent community transmission,

107
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.640
including stay-at-home orders, closing public spaces and recreation areas,

108
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.920
reducing or closing public transportation, and suspending schools and universities.

109
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.280
Ensuring compliance with these measures has required clear and consistent risk communication,

110
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.720
provided by trusted authorities. The intent of these public health measures

111
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.920
is to reduce the rate of new infections,

112
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.400
and limit the number of severely ill people requiring hospitalization, to ensure

113
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.520
the healthcare system has sufficient beds, ventilators, and other critical resources

114
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.120
– both for COVID-19 patients, as well as all others requiring urgent medical care.

115
00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.280
Once the number of new cases drops, governments and local authorities can begin to decide

116
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.680
whether certain economic or social activities can resume

117
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.960
– though such relaxing of measures should be done carefully, deliberately, and

118
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.400
only in parallel with sufficient testing capacity to assess any new surges in case numbers.

119
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.520
(Claire Standley) These efforts require close operational coordination

120
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.960
across multiple sectors – public health epidemiologists who are analyzing case data;

121
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.040
laboratorians conducting diagnostic tests;

122
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.160
logisticians, determining how to ensure frontline

123
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.760
health care workers have sufficient personal protective equipment;

124
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.280
and public outreach experts, who are responsible for communicating

125
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.640
key policy decisions to the public and other affected stakeholders.

126
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.560
Operational response efforts also need to be coordinated

127
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.440
with broader policy decision-making processes,

128
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.160
managed by national and sub-national political leaders.

129
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.680
In all these ways, COVID-19 response efforts can benefit

130
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.400
from application of core Emergency Management principles,

131
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.040
including coordination through structures like emergency operations centers.

132
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.280
(Claire Standley) Georgetown University has collaborated

133
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.280
with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

134
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.960
to create this website containing training materials, checklists, and other resources

135
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.360
for development and strengthening of public health emergency management capacities,

136
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.120
with an emphasis on emergency operations centers.

137
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.840
These materials are organized into seven sections,

138
00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.480
covering the basics of why emergency operations centers are important;

139
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.680
how they are structured and organized;

140
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.720
how they should be designed and equipped,

141
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.760
considering all different resource settings and requirements;

142
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.680
how they are activated, operationalized, and deactivated;

143
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.040
and finally, what efforts are needed to keep

144
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.960
emergency operations centers and staff prepared outside of emergencies.

145
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.480
Within each section, you will find an introductory presentation

146
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.800
covering the main concepts, together with additional references,

147
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.680
