00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:12.330
Claire Standley (she/her): Dr Phelan, thank you so much for coming to do this recorded interview on emergency management legislation so, could you please briefly introduce yourself and where you work and some of your background, please.

2
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.190
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): So, my name is Dr Alexandra Phelan, I'm an assistant professor at the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University Medical Center.

3
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.970
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): And an adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center.

4
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.540
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): And I study the international legal frameworks that we have in place the the laws and policies for preventing and responding to infectious disease outbreaks.

5
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.290
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): And then, how those laws and policies are then implemented from the global public health level to the domestic public health level.

6
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.660
Claire Standley (she/her): Oh fantastic So what are some of the key pieces of global legislation or global frameworks that help guide public health emergency management.

7
00:00:49.440 --> 00:01:02.580
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): yeah so the the big Center the sort of most critical piece of international law for preparing and responding to infectious diseases and health emergency management is the International Health Regulations in.

8
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:12.660
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): 2005 these entered into force, and so they've been around for about 16 years with not too much modifications, but what they do put in place is a series of.

9
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.640
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): obligations on countries to rapidly report potential public health emergencies of international concern and share information.

10
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.980
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): and also in the before you have a potential public health emergency of international concern to build.

11
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.340
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): Local core capacities in a range of different areas, including surveillance and response capabilities.

12
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:42.930
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): And so, by building that sort of national those core capacities, the idea is that you know everyone around the world is better better prepared at the domestic level to be able to share information and inform other countries about the.

13
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.610
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): Potential potential outbreaks.

14
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.820
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): there's not a huge amount governing response in the I, in the International Health Regulations, it is really focused on preparedness and notification.

15
00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:02.040
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): And there isn't a huge amount of guidelines, although the you know countries do have to implement measures that might affect international travelers.

16
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:12.990
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): In a way, that's respectful of scientific evidence and it's considered of human rights, but you know it's pretty open in terms of what is available domestically to go to happen.

17
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:21.420
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): There are a couple of other pieces of international that through touch upon and have relevance, indirectly, so the Nagoya protocol.

18
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.050
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): governs access to genetic resources which can include say pathogen samples necessary for.

19
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:38.790
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): identifying a pathogen and causing an outbreak is and sharing information, perhaps developing vaccines diagnostics therapeutics and sharing the benefits.

20
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.720
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): back with the country of origin, and you know, there are a range of different international laws to touch on, but when it comes to what affects.

21
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:56.370
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): Public health emergency management, the IHR really are the center and it is worth being aware that other fields do have relevant information, like the Sendai framework on disaster risk reduction.

22
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:09.090
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): So when you have multi sectoral Disaster Response frameworks domestically, even though the Sendai framework is not legally binding, it does have a range of targets that can be useful for building up that local capacity for responding to emergencies.

23
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:25.560
Claire Standley (she/her): Fantastic so so you mentioned these these legally binding international frameworks right so what's the relationship then to domestic legislation versus say policies or other regulatory instruments and How important is it to have those legal frameworks in place at the national level.

24
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:37.590
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): yeah so when it comes to say something like the International Health Regulations, they are legally binding on all 194 WHO Member States and two additional states who have signed up to agree to follow them.

25
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.220
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): And what that requires is as part of the core capacities is there is a national legislation core capacity.

26
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.920
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): As well as financing for capacity, and that requires countries to having their domestic systems.

27
00:03:50.550 --> 00:04:00.930
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): National legislation that supports the supports all the other implementation of the IHR so when it comes to say setting up an emergency operations Center.

28
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.610
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): That could be the sort of thing that is covered in the national legislation, particularly if it's tied into surveillance and response and the ability to to notify.

29
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.360
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): and continuously share information once an outbreak has begun.

30
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:23.760
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): At the sort of at the national and sub national levels and the IHR do require capacities at the local subnational so you know state or provincial, as well as the national level.

31
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:34.530
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): So there is this requirement that domestically within your country, you have that sharing of information and those capacities to go from you know event based surveillance indicator based of surveillance up through.

32
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:47.310
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): information sharing, up to the national level, where there can be assessments made either at the EOC if it's been established or pre-EOC of whether that that outbreak needs to be reported, or what information needs to be to be shared.

33
00:04:48.540 --> 00:05:02.490
Claire Standley (she/her): yeah fantastic so you sort of alluded to this already, but you have any other examples, specifically of of ways countries can approach implementing national legislation for public health emergency management and and really where might they be able to get support and doing so.

34
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.440
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): yeah, so I think.

35
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.030
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): One of the first step is actually to do an assessment of what our current existing powers and authorities.

36
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:22.200
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): Are there clear processes for the establishment of an EOC, are there clear powers and authorities what needs to be done to either establish or then give the.

37
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:36.450
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): EOC the power to do what they need to do, and you know we can do a desk review and do a legal review and actually assess what laws are on the books and often there may be less laws than you expect particularly when it comes to specific things like an EOC. 

38
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:47.280
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): But one way to really test that because that's that only gets you so far is to actually run simulations where you do actually test the decision making process, the establishment of.

39
00:05:47.550 --> 00:06:01.860
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): Whatever procedure you're wanting to look at and then its operation, you know how does it get information, where it's bottlenecks and the decision sort of areas we you might want to either reform, the law or add in additional law or remove potential barriers.

40
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:10.560
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): So, you know that that's kind of a good way of assessing and then testing, you know after action reviews, particularly post COVID-19

41
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.670
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): will be obviously a part of that that process of assessment.

42
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:26.520
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): And you know, there are the other tools out there, like the joint external evaluation and other metrics that are used to assess where you might have gaps, but they tend to not really doing much on national legislation.

43
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.410
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): Or at least at the level probably needed to really test where your where your bottlenecks are.

44
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:39.150
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): So, in terms of getting support, and you know we work quite closely with the WHO in, say, the Eastern Mediterranean region, where we are

45
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:48.510
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): invited by countries to review their public health laws, you know work with the country to provide any feedback or identifying potential challenges that they've had.

46
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:57.660
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): and propose potential reforms every country's legal system is different, even countries that have very similar legal systems have a different way in which that laura's implemented so.

47
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:08.970
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): You know model laws can be useful or laws from other countries can be useful examples just to really pull from but you know you really can't just transplant one law to another country you need to look at the whole context.

48
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:21.420
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): whole legal environment How does that operate, and so you know groups like you know who is the regional offices have been generally pretty good at providing that sort of support, but that's that's definitely something that we do as well.

49
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:35.130
Claire Standley (she/her): Fantastic I think that's a really helpful overview to the broader questions about how legislative frameworks can both provide guidance, but also help support countries and implementing some of these core capacities for for epidemic response.

50
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.730
Claire Standley (she/her): and any final thoughts or points that you'd like to share or add.

51
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.220
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): You know I think there will be.

52
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.320
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): there'll be a lot of changes with this pandemic two laws we had before.

53
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.990
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): Either they will be court cases that potentially have limited the opposite like what governments can do.

54
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:58.050
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): or change the interpretation of what we thought before the pandemics, so I think it's really important that any sort of.

55
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:07.560
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): Mid or post pandemic assessments really do take into account how the public health landscape in a country may have changed and, particularly, you know.

56
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:20.370
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): ios is going to have the sufficient authority to do what they need to do, and what are the sort of the safeguards around that so you know we can't assume that something we did three years ago is still going to be the case after this pandemic.

57
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:29.910
Claire Standley (she/her): Fantastic well, thank you again so much for your time to fill in and i'm sure, anyone who sees this lecture is going to be really grateful for the expertise that you've shared today thanks so much.

58
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.440
Alexandra PHELAN (she/her): Thank you so much, Dr Standley.
