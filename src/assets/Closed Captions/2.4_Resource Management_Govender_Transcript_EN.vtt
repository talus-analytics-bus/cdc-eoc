00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:14.580
Claire Standley (she/her): hi well Thank you so much for being here today to chat a bit about resource management in the context of a PHEOC so just to kick us off, could you please introduce yourself and briefly describe your position and your background.

2
00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.230
Nevashan Govender: Thanks so much for having me. Nevashan Govender.

3
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.650
Nevashan Govender: I currently am the operations manager at the EOC at the National Institute of communicable diseases.

4
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:45.570
Nevashan Govender: And it's a strange position for me to, that I find myself in I have, because I have a background as a medical scientist my interest that at that point was antimicrobial resistance, but then I found a new love in public health and became a field epidemiologist.

5
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.680
Nevashan Govender: So, in the current role to try and tie everything together.

6
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.050
Claire Standley (she/her): Fantastic and I'm sure there's opportunities to explore AMR as well, even within that capacity through the investigation side at least.

7
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:13.530
Claire Standley (she/her): So obviously in your role within the EOC there's a lot to think about in terms of resources and managing those resources So could you briefly describe some of the major considerations, you have to bear in mind when you're thinking about resource management in the EOC.

8
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.670
Nevashan Govender: So EOCs, public health EOCs are a

9
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:30.240
Nevashan Govender: Very taxing very challenging environment and resources are critical to delivering on audio objectives, whether it's day today or in a response.

10
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.130
Nevashan Govender: The type of resources that you would consider human resources, the actual facility itself if you're not operating a virtual.

11
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.180
Nevashan Govender: EOC even if you are creating a virtual EOC  you need systems and backups and good IT infrastructure.

12
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.510
Nevashan Govender: and your materials that you would use for you're responsible for day to day activities.

13
00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:14.400
Nevashan Govender: and your equipment, whether it be your your large piece of equipment like video conferencing facilities or your small day to day office items and human resources and emc is nothing without people and with the relevant expertise for whatever objectivity, is that you're trying to achieve.

14
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:29.370
Nevashan Govender: You know, all these resources human resources internally available to your organization or institute, you know, wherever the EOC is placed or do you need to second these people from from other institutions or places of work or

15
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.190
Nevashan Govender: Invariably, what does happen in a response, especially is that you have to do, new hires.

16
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.830
Nevashan Govender: And these come at an expense. That leads me into the next consideration, which is funding. Funding for EOCs is

17
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:54.150
Nevashan Govender: really important when you're setting up an EOC initially funding is immense and then to run it and then your your responses.

18
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.560
Nevashan Govender: to tie that all together now, you need good systems information management, etc, is run on information.

19
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.750
Nevashan Govender: and communication.

20
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.710
Nevashan Govender: Communication is central to to how an EOC operates, both internally and externally, with its stakeholders.

21
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:22.260
Nevashan Govender: And then you need to appreciate that you resource needs changes as your scenario changes as your response needs changes and so you have to be flexible.

22
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:38.820
Claire Standley (she/her): super yeah and of course you're you're sitting at the national level in your current role and are there any ways or specific ways I should say that some of those resource considerations might differ between, say, the national under sub national and provincial level.

23
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.340
Nevashan Govender: Definitely, there are some differences but, in the main the considerations are the same.

24
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.900
Nevashan Govender: You know, general principles around how EOCs operate are the same. However,

25
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.100
Nevashan Govender: The mechanisms on all the.

26
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:17.880
Nevashan Govender: way in which is resource needs and resource management is conducted at a sub national level is a direct effect of the policies and governance structure of those provincial, so here in South Africa, for example, it is the provincial.

27
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:38.880
Nevashan Govender: municipal or district level, and those are the main differences, you know whether they've budgeted for certain things, how they access funding the type of human resources that they have available and their mechanisms for being able to access this may be.

28
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:55.740
Nevashan Govender: And are slightly different. I think the the main consideration for us is that we're all governed by the same acts, and so we can try and work within those for the most part.

29
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:15.270
Claire Standley (she/her): Super, thank you, and so you, you mentioned the challenges of identifying resource needs so, are there any specific tools or approaches that you use to get a sense for what kind of resource requirements you're going to have in the context either of the EOC generally or a specific response.

30
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:27.750
Nevashan Govender: So you know, there are a number of of tools and a number of ways in which we have gone about it, and you know various activations or responses.

31
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:36.540
Nevashan Govender: Are number one tool is engagement, continued engagement with your incident management structure, incident management team.

32
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:51.030
Nevashan Govender: And this, and the technical leads, so that you can provide the resource specific sorry response specific resources and because of the dynamic nature of response, as I mentioned previously, these do change.

33
00:05:52.140 --> 00:06:01.650
Nevashan Govender: What we've done very successfully here in South Africa is that we've used within the EOC at least an MS excel Microsoft excel resource management tool.

34
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:22.140
Nevashan Govender: So anybody could use it, I have very good admin support when and procurement support whenever we've activated and it is shared across those teams, those local admin and procurement teams, to be able to manage budgets, the resource resource level stock levels.

35
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.290
Nevashan Govender: You know, for the for the different teams.

36
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.980
Nevashan Govender: And that leads me to the next point, which is the integration of procurement into the IMS structure.

37
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.120
Nevashan Govender: If you have very good.

38
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:40.020
Nevashan Govender: procurement systems, you know you can manage your budget, you can manage your resources very well.

39
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:50.490
Nevashan Govender: and stick within the policies stick within within government structures so that you know resources have been used for the specific objectives.

40
00:06:51.990 --> 00:07:06.720
Nevashan Govender: But a lot of this, you can try to set up up front, and that is through proper planning and part of planning is to do exercises and to have in place costed incident response plans.

41
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:16.170
Nevashan Govender: And through that it makes it a lot easier to track your expenses using basic tools like like Microsoft excel.

42
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.310
Nevashan Govender: And then, as I mentioned, you know, makes it a lot easier to adhere to your policies, the national legislation.

43
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:29.430
Nevashan Govender: For example, during the COVID, our our local COVID outbreak.

44
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.340
Nevashan Govender: We had to work with a supplier of oxygen.

45
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.050
Nevashan Govender: In the country, Afrox, to be able to monitor oxygen levels across the country.

46
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:48.840
Nevashan Govender: and a specific tool needed to be created for that purpose and so we've taken lots of lessons from that for hospital management.

47
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.780
Nevashan Govender: and other aspects of responses so.

48
00:07:52.830 --> 00:08:05.160
Nevashan Govender: It shows that, because of the dynamic nature, you need to be able to work within your structures, as well as use very basic tools that can speak to everybody within the IMS to do it.

49
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:14.940
Claire Standley (she/her): yeah I love, how you mentioned actually all of the different functions of the IMS there, so you really highlighting how they all work together right there's procurement.

50
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:24.690
Claire Standley (she/her): The logistic side there's the finance administration side the planning side, and of course in support of operation, so I think that was a really great example of the power of IMS as well, in terms of.

51
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:41.550
Claire Standley (she/her): Thinking about resource management. And so obviously though in a response, not everything will go exactly as planned at sometimes, and so what happens when there isn't a good alignment between your available resources and your resource needs what happens when there's a gap.

52
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:52.380
Nevashan Govender: that nobody loves loves a curveball nobody at all, I think the only person that likes the curve ball is the is the baseball pitcher that's throwing it.

53
00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:02.880
Nevashan Govender: But these happen, and they happen in every response, they also happen day today when you're you know you're doing your your surveillance.

54
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:25.800
Nevashan Govender: So you need flexibility and I think the number one thing is as people working within the EOC is not to panic, because the fact is that your response needs and your objectives will not be met, then you need to be flexible and realistic enough to be able to understand that.

55
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:35.610
Nevashan Govender: Any project management, there is the term called crashing a project, where you need to be able to shift resources and shift time timelines.

56
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.040
Nevashan Govender: And shift tasks, so that you are able to meet these objectives.

57
00:09:42.720 --> 00:10:00.900
Nevashan Govender: So task shifting, flexible timelines to be able to match your available resources is extremely important and how and how you are able to do this is through proper communication early on, with your stakeholders within the IMS.

58
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.710
Nevashan Govender: Not just at the top, but from the top down, and from the bottom up information has to flow.

59
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:20.040
Nevashan Govender: To be able to do this effectively will will negate unnecessary panic and potential reputational damage, especially at the national level where we are.

60
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:28.980
Nevashan Govender: Because that is an effect of poor resource management and other results can be poor communication.

61
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:42.420
Nevashan Govender: ineffective information sharing with relevant stakeholders, and this will definitely and we've experienced it threaten operational work the operational working environment because within your team.

62
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:56.940
Nevashan Govender: If you have very poor resource management, that the team or all just folds absolutely flat and people don't feel motivated to be able to deliver on their tasks without the appropriate tools or personnel.

63
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:04.740
Nevashan Govender: So these are some of the effects of misalignment of your resource needs and what's available.

64
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:13.380
Claire Standley (she/her): And, of course, keeping your your staff happy is one another aspect of resource management right because they are one of your core resources within the EOC.

65
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.250
Nevashan Govender: 100% you got to keep them happy and you better keep them fit.

66
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:25.320
Claire Standley (she/her): yeah yeah fantastic well Thank you so much again for chatting about this today and really interesting comments, and I think very applicable.

67
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:41.100
Claire Standley (she/her): across many settings local intermediate national level but also even potentially within our own lives right don't panic communicate well, these are really from lessons just for for managing collaborations in general, so thank you again so much and really appreciate your time today.

68
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.230
Nevashan Govender: Thank you so much for having me.
